      This is the introductory article to a series which will contain a full
      explanation and exposure of patent-medicine methods, and the harm done to
      the public by this industry, founded mainly on fraud and poison. Results
      of the publicity given to these methods can already be seen in the steps
      recently taken by the National Government, some State Governments and a
      few of the more reputable newspapers. The object of the series is to make
      the situation so familiar and thoroughly understood that there will be a
      speedy end to the worst aspects of the evil.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Gullible America will spend this year some seventy-five millions of
      dollars in the purchase of patent medicines. In consideration of this sum
      it will swallow huge quantities of alcohol, an appalling amount of opiates
      and narcotics, a wide assortment of varied drugs ranging from powerful and
      dangerous heart depressants to insidious liver stimulants; and, far in
      excess of all other ingredients, undiluted fraud. For fraud, exploited by
      the skillfulest of advertising bunco men, is the basis of the trade.
      Should the newspapers, the magazines and the medical journals refuse their
      pages to this class of advertisements, the patent-medicine business in
      five years would be as scandalously historic as the South Sea Bubble, and
      the nation would be the richer not only in lives and money, but in
      drunkards and drug-fiends saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't make the mistake of lumping all proprietary medicines in one
      indiscriminate denunciation," came warning from all sides when this series
      was announced. But the honest attempt to separate the sheep from the goats
      develops a lamentable lack of qualified candidates for the sheepfold.
      External remedies there may be which are at once honest in their claims
      and effective for their purposes; they are not to be found among the
      much-advertised ointments or applications which fill the public prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuticura may be a useful preparation, but in extravagance of advertising
      it rivals the most clamorous cure-all. Pond's Extract, one would naturally
      suppose, could afford to restrict itself to decent methods, but in the
      recent <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p004.png">[004]</a></span>epidemic
      scare in New York it traded on the public alarm by putting forth "display"
      advertisements headed, in heavy black type, "Meningitis," a disease in
      which witch-hazel is about as effective as molasses. This is fairly
      comparable to Peruna's ghoulish exploitation, for profit, of the
      yellow-fever scourge in New Orleans, aided by various southern newspapers
      of standing, which published as <i>news</i> an "interview" with Dr.
      Hartman, president of the Peruna Company.

    <h2>
      Drugs That Make Victims.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When one comes to the internal remedies, the proprietary medicines proper,
      they all belong to the tribe of Capricorn, under one of two heads,
      harmless frauds or deleterious drugs. For instance, the laxatives perform
      what they promise; if taken regularly, as thousands of people take them
      (and, indeed, as the advertisements urge), they become an increasingly
      baneful necessity. Acetanilid will undoubtedly relieve headache of certain
      kinds; but acetanilid, as the basis of headache powders, is prone to
      remove the cause of the symptoms permanently by putting a complete stop to
      the heart action. Invariably, when taken steadily, it produces
      constitutional disturbances of insidious development which result fatally
      if the drug be not discontinued, and often it enslaves the devotee to its
      use. Cocain and opium stop pain; but the narcotics are not the safest
      drugs to put into the hands of the ignorant, particularly when their
      presence is concealed in the "cough remedies," "soothing syrups," and
      "catarrhal powders" of which they are the basis. Few outside of the rabid
      temperance advocates will deny a place in medical practice to alcohol. But
      alcohol, fed daily and in increasing doses to women and children, makes
      not for health, but for drunkenness. Far better whiskey or gin
      unequivocally labeled than the alcohol-laden "bitters," "sarsaparillas"
      and "tonics" which exhilerate fatuous temperance advocates to the point of
      enthusiastic testimonials.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these "cures" really does cure any serious affection, although a
      majority of their users recover. But a majority, and a very large
      majority, of the sick recover, anyway. Were it not so&mdash;were one
      illness out of fifty fatal&mdash;this earth would soon be depopulated.

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      As to Testimonials.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ignorant drug-taker, returning to health from some disease which he
      has overcome by the natural resistant powers of his body, dips his pen in
      gratitude and writes his testimonial. The man who dies in spite of the
      patent medicine&mdash;or perhaps because of it&mdash;doesn't bear witness
      to what it did for him. We see recorded only the favorable results: the
      unfavorable lie silent. How could it be otherwise when the only avenues of
      publicity are controlled by the advertisers? So, while many of the printed
      testimonials are genuine enough, they represent not the average evidence,
      but the most glowing opinions which the nostrum vender can obtain, and
      generally they are the expression of a low order of intelligence. Read in
      this light, they are unconvincing enough. But the innocent public regards
      them as the type, not the exception. "If that cured Mrs. Smith of Oshgosh
      it may cure me," says the woman whose symptoms, real or imaginary, are so
      feelingly described under the picture. Lend ear to expert testimony from a
      certain prominent cure-all:
    </p>
    <p>
      "They see my advertising. They read the testimonials. They are convinced.
      They have faith in Peruna. It gives them a gentle stimulant and so they
      get well."
    </p>
    <p>
      There it is in a nutshell; the faith cure. Not the stimulant, but the
      faith inspired by the advertisement and encouraged by the stimulant does
      the work&mdash;or seems to do it. If the public drugger can convince his
      patron <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p005.png">[005]</a></span>that
      she is well, she <i>is</i> well&mdash;for his purposes. In the case of
      such diseases as naturally tend to cure themselves, no greater harm is
      done than the parting of a fool and his money. With rheumatism, sciatica
      and that ilk, it means added pangs; with consumption, Bright's disease and
      other serious disorders, perhaps needless death. No onus of homicide is
      borne by the nostrum seller; probably the patient would have died anyway;
      there is no proof that the patent bottle was in any way responsible. Even
      if there were&mdash;and rare cases do occur where the responsibility can
      be brought home&mdash;there is no warning to others, because the
      newspapers are too considerate of their advertisers to publish such
      injurious items.

    <h2>
      The Magic "Red Clause."
    </h2>
    <p>
      With a few honorable exceptions the press of the United States is at the
      beck and call of the patent medicines. Not only do the newspapers modify
      news possibly affecting these interests, but they sometimes become their
      active agents. F. J. Cheney, proprietor of Hall's Catarrh Cure, devised
      some years ago a method of making the press do his fighting against
      legislation compelling makers of remedies to publish their formulæ, or to
      print on the labels the dangerous drugs contained in the medicine&mdash;a
      constantly recurring bugaboo of the nostrum-dealer. This scheme he
      unfolded at a meeting of the Proprietary Association of America, of which
      he is now president. He explained that he printed in red letters on every
      advertising contract a clause providing that the contract should become
      void in the event of hostile legislation, and he boasted how he had used
      this as a club in a case where an Illinois legislator had, as he put it,
      attempted to hold him for three hundred dollars on a strike bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I had a better plan than this," said Mr. Cheney to his
      associates, "so I wrote to about forty papers and merely said: 'Please
      look at your contract with me and take note that if this law passes you
      and I must stop doing business,' The next week every one of them had an
      article and Mr. Man had to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      So emphatically did this device recommend itself to the assemblage that
      many of the large firms took up the plan, and now the "red clause" is a
      familiar device in the trade. The reproduction printed on page 6 {p006} is
      a fac-simile of a contract between Mr. Cheney's firm and the Emporia <i>Gazette</i>,
      William Allen White's paper, which has since become one of the newspapers
      to abjure the patent-medicine man and all his ways. Emboldened by this
      easy coercion of the press, certain firms have since used the newspapers
      as a weapon against "price-cutting," by forcing them to refuse advertising
      of the stores which reduce rates on patent medicines. Tyrannical masters,
      these heavy purchasers of advertising space.
    </p>
    <p>
      To what length daily journalism will go at the instance of the business
      office was shown in the great advertising campaign of Paine's Celery
      Compound, some years ago. The nostrum's agent called at the office of a
      prominent Chicago newspaper and spread before its advertising manager a
      full-page advertisement, with blank spaces in the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We want some good, strong testimonials to fill out with," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can get all of those you want, can't you?" asked the newspaper
      manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can <i>you?</i>" returned the other. "Show me four or five strong ones
      from local politicians and you get the ad."

      Fake Testimonials.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That day reporters were assigned to secure testimonials with photographs
      which subsequently appeared in the full-page advertisement as promised. As
      for the men who permitted the use of their names for this <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p006.png">[006]</a></span>purpose,
      several of them afterward admitted that they had never tasted the
      "Compound," but that they were willing to sign the testimonials for the
      joy of appearing in print as "prominent citizens." Another Chicago
      newspaper compelled its political editor to tout for fake indorsements of
      a nostrum. A man with an inside knowledge of the patent-medicine business
      made some investigations into this phase of the matter, and he declares
      that such procurement of testimonials became so established as to have the
      force of a system, only two Chicago papers being free from it.

    <p>
      To-day, he adds, a similar "deal" could be made with half a dozen of that
      city's dailies. It is disheartening to note that in the case of one
      important and high-class daily, the Pittsburg <i>Gazette</i>, a trial
      rejection of all patent-medicine advertising received absolutely no
      support or encouragement from the public; so the paper reverted to its old
      policy.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p008.png">[008]</a></span> The
      control is as complete, though exercised by a class of nostrums somewhat
      differently exploited, but essentially the same. Only "ethical"
      preparations are permitted in the representative medical press, that is,
      articles not advertised in the lay press. Yet this distinction is not
      strictly adhered to. "Syrup of Figs," for instance, which makes widespread
      pretense in the dailies to be an extract of the fig, advertises in the
      medical journals for what it is, a preparation of senna. Antikamnia, an
      "ethical" proprietary compound, for a long time exploited itself to the
      profession by a campaign of ridiculous extravagance, and is to-day by the
      extent of its reckless <i>use</i> on the part of ignorant laymen a public
      menace. Recently an article announcing a startling new drug discovery and
      signed by a physician was offered to a standard medical journal, which
      declined it on learning that the drug was a proprietary preparation. The
      contribution was returned to the editor with an offer of payment at
      advertising rates if it were printed as editorial reading matter, only to
      be rejected on the new basis. Subsequently it appeared simultaneously in
      more than twenty medical publications as reading matter. There are to-day
      very few medical publications which do not carry advertisements conceived
      in the same spirit and making much tin same exhaustive claims as the
      ordinary quack "ads" of the daily press, and still fewer that are free
      from promises to "cure" diseases which are incurable by any medicine. Thus
      the medical press is as strongly enmeshed by the "ethical" druggers as the
      lay press is by Paine, "Dr." Kilmer, Lydia Pinkham, Dr. Hartman, "Hall" of
      the "red clause" and the rest of the edifying band of life-savers, leaving
      no agency to refute the megaphone exploitation of the fraud. What
      opposition there is would naturally arise in the medical profession, but
      this is discounted by the proprietary interests.

      The Doctors Are Investigating.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "You attack us because we cure your patients," is their charge. They
      assume always that the public has no grievance against them, or, rather,
      they calmly ignore the public in the matter. In his address at the last
      convention of the Proprietary Association, the retiring president, W. A.
      Talbot of Piso's Consumption Cure, turning his guns on the medical
      profession, delivered this astonishing sentiment:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No argument favoring the publication of our formulas was ever uttered
      which does not apply with equal force to your prescriptions. It is
      pardonable in you to want to know these formulas, for they are good. But
      you must not ask us to reveal these valuable secrets, to do what you would
      not do yourselves. The public and our law-makers do not want your secrets
      nor ours, <i>and it would be a damage to them to have them</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The physicians seem to have awakened, somewhat tardily, indeed, to
      counter-attack. The American Medical Association has organized a Council
      on Pharmacy and Chemistry to investigate and pass on the "ethical"
      preparations advertised to physicians, with a view to listing those which
      are found to be reputable and useful. That this is regarded as a direct
      assault on the proprietary interests is suggested by the protests,
      eloquent to the verge of frenzy in some cases, emanating from those organs
      which the manufacturers control. Already the council has issued some
      painfully frank reports on products of imposingly scientific nomenclature;
      and more are to follow.

      What One Druggist Is Doing.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Largely for trade reasons a few druggists have been fighting the nostrums,
      but without any considerable effect. Indeed, it is surprising to see that
      people are so deeply impressed with the advertising claims put forth daily
      as to be impervious to warnings even from experts. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p009.png">[009]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      A cut-rate store, the Economical Drug Company of Chicago, started on a
      campaign and displayed a sign in the window reading:
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p009.png">[009]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <h4>
      PLEASE DO NOT ASK US
    </h4>
    <p>
      What is ANY OLD PATENT MEDICINE Worth?
    </p>
    <p>
      For you embarrass us, as our honest answer must be that IT IS WORTHLESS
    </p>
    <p>
      If you mean to ask at what price we sell it, that is an entirely different
      proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      When sick, consult a good physician. It is the only proper course. And you
      will find it cheaper in the end than self-medication with worthless
      "patent" nostrums.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was followed up by the salesmen informing all applicants for the
      prominent nostrums that they were wasting money. Yet with all this that
      store was unable to get rid of its patent-medicine trade, and to-day
      nostrums comprise one-third of its entire business. They comprise about
      two-thirds of that of the average small store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legislation is the most obvious remedy, pending the enlightenment of the
      general public or the awakening of the journalistic conscience. But
      legislation proceeds slowly and always against opposition, which may be
      measured in practical terms as $250,000,000 at stake on the other side. I
      note in the last report of the Proprietary Association's annual meeting
      the significant statement that "the heaviest expenses were incurred in
      legislative work." Most of the legislation must be done by states, and we
      have seen in the case of the Hall Catarrh cure contract how readily this
      may be controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two government agencies, at least, lend themselves to the purposes of the
      patent-medicine makers. The Patent Office issues to them trade-mark
      registration (generally speaking, the convenient term "patent medicine" is
      a misnomer, as very few are patented) without inquiry into the nature of
      the article thus safeguarded against imitation. The Post Office Department
      permits them the use of the mails. Except one particular line, the
      disgraceful "Weak Manhood" remedies, where excellent work has been done in
      throwing them out of the mails for fraud, the department has done nothing
      in the matter of patent remedies, and has no present intention of doing
      anything; yet I believe that such action, powerful as would be <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p010.png">[010]</a></span>the opposition
      developed, would be upheld by the courts on the same grounds that
      sustained the Post Office's position in the recent case of "Robusto."

    <p>
      That the advertising and circular statements circulated through the mails

      defrauding those into whose hands the statements came;
    </p>
    <p>
      That, while the remedies did possess medicinal properties, these were not
      such as to carry out the cures promised;

      That the advertiser knew he was deceiving;
    </p>
    <p>
      That in the sale and distribution of his medicines the complainant made no
      inquiry into the specific character of the disease in any individual case,
      but supplied the same remedies and prescribed the same mode of treatment
      to all alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the department apply these principles to the patent-medicine field
      generally, a number of conspicuous nostrums would cease to be pat-, rons
      of Uncle Sam's mail service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some states have made a good start in the matter of legislation, among
      them Michigan, which does not, however, enforce its recent strong law.
      Massachusetts, which has done more, through the admirable work of its
      State Board of Health, than any other agency to educate the public on the
      patent-medicine question, is unable to get a law restricting this trade.
      In New Hampshire, too, the proprietary interests have proven too strong,
      and the Mallonee bill was destroyed by the almost united opposition of a
      "red-clause" press. North Dakota proved more independent. After Jan. 1,
      1906, all medicines sold in that state, except on physicians'
      prescriptions, which contain chloral, ergot, morphin, opium, cocain,
      bromin, iodin or any of their compounds or derivatives, or more than 5 per
      cent, of alcohol, must so state on the label. When this bill became a law,
      the Proprietary Association of America proceeded to blight the state by
      resolving that its members should offer no goods for sale there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boards of health in various parts of the country are doing valuable
      educational work, the North Dakota board having led in the legislation.
      The Massachusetts, Connecticut and North Carolina boards have been active.
      The New York State board has kept its hands off patent medicines, but the
      Board of Pharmacy has made a cautious but promising beginning by
      compelling all makers of powders containing cocain to put a poison label
      on their goods; and it proposes to extend this ruling gradually to other
      dangerous compositions.

    <h2>
      Health Boards and Analyses.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is somewhat surprising to find the Health Department of New York City,
      in many respects the foremost in the country, making no use of carefully
      and rather expensively acquired knowledge which would serve to protect the
      public. More than two years ago analyses were made by the chemists of the
      department which showed dangerous quantities of cocain in a number of
      catarrh powders. These analyses have never been printed. Even the general
      nature of the information has been withheld. Should any citizen of New
      York, going to the Health Department, have asked: "My wife is taking
      Birney's Catarrh Powder; is it true that it's a bad thing?" the officials,
      with the knowledge at hand that the drug in question is a mater of cocain
      fiends, would have blandly emulated the Sphinx. Outside criticism of an
      overworked, undermanned and generally efficient department is liable to
      error through ignorance of the problems involved in its administration;
      yet one can not but believe that some form of warning against what is
      wisely admittedly a public menace would have been a wiser form <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p011.png">[011]</a></span>of procedure
      than that which has heretofore been discovered by the formula, "policy of
      the department."
    </p>
    <p>
      Policies change and broaden under pressure of conditions. The Health
      Commissioner is now formulating a plan which, with the work of the
      chemists as a basis, shall check the trade in public poisons more or less
      concealed behind proprietary names.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible, even in a series of articles, to attempt more than an
      exemplary treatment of the patent-medicine frauds. The most degraded and
      degrading, the "lost vitality" and "blood disease" cures, reeking of
      terrorization and blackmail, can not from their very nature be treated of
      in a lay journal. Many dangerous and health-destroying compounds will
      escape through sheer inconspicuousness. I can touch on only a few of those
      which may be regarded as typical: the alcohol stimulators, as represented
      by Peruna, Paine's Celery Compound and Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey
      (advertised as an exclusively medical preparation); the catarrh powders,
      which breed cocain slaves, and the opium-containing soothing syrups, which
      stunt or kill helpless infants; the consumption cures, perhaps the most
      devilish of all, in that they destroy hope where hope is struggling
      against bitter odds for existence; the headache powders, which enslave so
      insidiously that the victim is ignorant of his own fate; the comparatively
      harmless fake as typified by that marvelous product of advertising and
      effrontery, Liquozone; and, finally, the system of exploitation and
      testimonials on which the whole vast system of bunco rests, as on a flimsy
      but cunningly constructed foundation.

      II. PERUNA AND THE BRACERS.

    <h4>
      Reprinted from Collier's Weekly, Oct. 28, 1905. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p012.png">[012]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      A distinguished public health official and medical writer once made this
      jocular suggestion to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us buy in large quantities the cheapest Italian vermouth, poor gin
      and bitters. We will mix them in the proportion of three of vermouth to
      two of gin, with a dash of bitters, dilute and bottle them by the short
      quart, label them '<i>Smith's Reviver ana Blood Purifier; dose, one
      wineglassful before each meal</i>'; advertise them to cure erysipelas,
      bunions, dyspepsia, heat rash, fever and ague, and consumption; and to
      prevent loss of hair, smallpox, old age, sunstroke and near-sightedness,
      and make our everlasting fortunes selling them to the temperance trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sounds to me very much like a cocktail," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is," he replied. "But it's just as much a medicine as Peruna and
      not as bad a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peruna, or, as its owner, Dr. S. B. Hartman, of Columbus, Ohio (once a
      physician in good standing), prefers to write it, Pe-ru-na, is at present
      the most prominent proprietary nostrum in the country. It has taken the
      place once held by Greene's Nervura and by Paine's Celery Compound, and
      for the same reason which made them popular. The name of that reason is
      alcohol.* Peruna is a stimulant pure and simple, and it is the more
      dangerous in that it sails under the false colors of a benign purpose.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Dr. Ashbel P. Grinnell of New York City, who has made a
     statistical study of patent medicines, asserts as a provable
     fact that more alcohol is consumed in this country in patent
     medicines than is dispensed in a legal way by licensed
     liquor venders, barring the sale of ales and beer.
</pre>
    <p>
      According to an authoritative statement given out in private circulation a
      few years ago by its proprietors, Peruna is a compound of seven drugs with
      cologne spirits. This formula, they assure me, has not been materially
      changed. None of the seven drugs is of any great potency. Their total is
      less than one-half of 1 per cent, of the product. Medicinally they are too
      inconsiderable, in this proportion, to produce any effect. There remains
      to Peruna only water and cologne spirits, roughly in the proportion of
      three to one. Cologne spirits is the commercial term for alcohol.

    </div>
    <h2>
      What Peruna Is Made Of.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Any one wishing to make Peruna for home consumption may do so by mixing
      half a pint of cologne spirits, 190 proof, with a pint and a half of
      water, adding thereto a little cubebs for flavor and a little burned sugar
      for color. Manufactured in bulk, so a former Peruna agent estimates, its
      cost, including bottle and wrapper, is between fifteen and eighteen cents
      a bottle. Its price is $1.00. Because of this handsome margin of profit,
      and by way of making hay in the stolen sunshine of Peruna advertising,
      many imitations have sprung up to harass the proprietors of the
      alcohol-and-water product. Pe-ru-vi-na, P-ru-na, Purina, Anurep (an
      obvious inversion); these, bottled and labeled to resemble Peruna, are
      self-confessed imitations. From what the Peruna people tell me, I gather
      that they are dangerous and damnable frauds, and that they cure nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does Peruna cure? Catarrh. That is the modest claim for it; nothing
      but catarrh. To be sure, a careful study of its literature will suggest
      its value as a tonic and a preventive of lassitude. But its reputation
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p013.png">[013]</a></span>rests on
      catarrh. What is catarrh? Whatever ails you. No matter what you've got,
      you will be not only enabled, but compelled, after reading Dr. Hartman's
      Peruna book, "The Ills of Life," to diagnose your illness as catarrh and
      to realize that Peruna alone will save you. Pneumonia is catarrh of the
      lungs; so is consumption. Dyspepsia is catarrh of the stomach. Enteritis
      is catarrh of the intestines. Appendicitis&mdash;surgeons, please note
      before operating&mdash;is catarrh of the appendix. Bright's disease is
      catarrh of the kidneys. Heart disease is catarrh of the heart. Canker
      sores are catarrh of the mouth. Measles is, perhaps, catarrh of the skin,
      since "a teaspoonful of Peruna thrice daily or oftener is an effectual
      cure" ("The Ills of Life"). Similarly, malaria, one may guess, is catarrh
      of the mosquito that bit you. Other diseases not specifically placed in
      the catarrhal class, but yielding to Peruna (in the book), are colic,
      mumps, convulsions, neuralgia, women's complaints and rheumatism. Yet
      "Peruna is not a cure-all," virtuously disclaims Dr. Hartman, and grasps
      at a golden opportunity by advertising his nostrum as a preventive against
      yellow fever! That alcohol and water, with a little coloring matter and
      one-half of 1 per cent, of mild drugs, will cure all or any of the ills
      listed above is too ridiculous to need refutation. Nor does Dr. Hartman
      himself personally make that claim for his product. He stated to me
      specifically and repeatedly that no drug or combination of drugs, with the
      possible exception of quinin for malaria, will cure disease. His claim is
      that the belief of the patient in Peruna, fostered as it is by the printed
      testimony, and aided by the "gentle stimulation," produces good results.
      It is well established that in certain classes of disease the opposite is
      true. A considerable proportion of tuberculosis cases show a history of
      the Peruna type of medicines taken in the early stages, with the result of
      diminishing the patient's resistant power, and much of the typhoid in the
      middle west is complicated by the victim's "keeping up" on this stimulus
      long after he should have been under a doctor's care. But it is not as a
      fraud on the sick alone that Peruna is baneful, but as the maker of
      drunkards also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can be used any length of time without acquiring a drug habit,"
      declares the Peruna book, and therein, I regret to say, lies specifically
      and directly. The lie is ingeniously backed up by Dr. Hartman's argument
      that "nobody could get drunk on the prescribed doses of Peruna."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this is true, though I note three wineglassfuls in forty-five
      minutes as a prescription which might temporarily alter a prohibitionist's
      outlook on life. But what makes Peruna profitable to the maker and a curse
      to the community at large is the fact that the minimum dose first ceases
      to satisfy, then the moderate dose, and finally the maximum dose; and the
      unsuspecting patron, who began with it as a medicine, goes on to use it as
      a beverage and finally to be enslaved by it as a habit. A well-known
      authority on drug addictions writes me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A number of physicians have called my attention to the use of Peruna,
      both preceding and following alcohol and drug addictions. Lydia Pinkham's
      Compound is another dangerous drug used largely by drinkers; Paine's
      Celery Compound also. I have in the last two years met four cases of
      persons who drank Peruna in large quantities to intoxication. This was
      given to them originally as a tonic. They were treated under my care as
      simple alcoholics."

      The Government Forbids the Sale of Peruna to Indians.

      Expert opinion on the non-medical side is represented in the government
      order to the Indian Department, reproduced on the following page, the
      kernel of which is this: <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p014.png">[014]</a></span>

    <h4>
      DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
    </h4>
    <h4>
      OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,
    </h4>
    <p>
      Washington, D. C., <i>August 10, 1905.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Indian Agents and School Superintendents in charge of Agencies:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The attention of the Office has been called to the fact that many licensed
      traders are very negligent as to the way in which their stores are kept.
      Some lack of order might he condoned, but it is reported that many stores
      are dirty even to filthiness. Such a condition of affairs need not be
      tolerated, and improvement in that respect must be insisted on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Office is not so inexperienced as to suppose that traders open stores
      among Indians from philanthropic motive's. Nevertheless a trader has a
      great influence among the Indians with whom he has constant dealings and
      who are often dependent upon him, and there are not a few instances in
      which the trader has exerted this influence for the welfare of his
      customers as well as for his own profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-kept store, tidy in appearance, where the goods, especially
      eatables, are handled in a cleanly way, with due regard to ordinary
      hygiene, and where exact business methods prevail is a civilizing
      influence among Indians, while disorder, slovenliness, slipshod ways, and
      dirt are demoralizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will please examine into the way in which the traders under your
      supervision conduct their stores, how their goods, particularly edible
      goods, are handled, stored, and given out, and see to it that in these
      respects, as well in respect of weights, prices, and account-keep-ing, the
      business is properly conducted. If any trader, after due notice, fails to
      come up to these requirements you will report him to this Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with this investigation, please give particular attention
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p016.png">[016]</a></span>to the
      proprietary medicines and other compounds which the traders keep in stock,
      with special reference to the liability of their misuse by Indians on
      account of the alcohol which they contain. The sale of Peruna, which is on
      the lists of several traders, is hereby absolutely prohibited. As a
      medicine, something else can be substituted; as an intoxicant, it has been
      found too tempting and effective. Anything of the sort under another name
      which is found to lead to intoxication you will please report to this
      Office. When a compound of that sort gets a bad name it is liable to be
      put on the market with some slight change of form and a new name. Jamaica
      ginger and flavoring extracts of vanilla, lemon, and so forth, should be
      kept in only small quantities and in small bottles and should not be sold
      to Indians, or at least only sparingly to those who it is known will use
      them only for legitimate purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, you will continue to give attention to the labeling of
      poisonous drugs with skull and cross-bones as per Office circular of
      January 12, 1905.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copies of this circular letter are herewith to be furnished the traders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, respectfully,

      Note, in the fifth paragraph, these sentences: "The sale of Peruna which

      been found too tempting."

      Alcohol In "Medicines" And In Liquors.

      These diagrams show what would be left in a bottle of patent medicine If
      everything was poured out except the alcohol; they also show the quantity
      of alcohol that would be present if the same bottle had contained whisky,
      champagne, claret or beer. It is apparent that a bottle of Peruna contains
      as much alcohol as five bottles of beer, or three bottles of claret or
      champagne&mdash;that is, bottles of the same size. It would take nearly
      nine bottles of beer to put as much alcohol into a thirsty man's system as
      a temperance advocate can get by drinking one bottle of Hostetter's
      Stomach Bitters. While the "doses" prescribed by the patent medicine
      manufacturers are only one to two teaspoonfuls several times a day, the
      opportunity to take more exists, and even small doses of alcohol, taken
      regularly, cause that craving which is the first step in the making of a
      drunkard or drag fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specific evidence of what Peruna can do will be found in the following
      report, verified by special investigation:
    </p>
    <p>
      Pinedale, Wyo., Oct. 4.&mdash; (Special.)&mdash;"Two men suffering from
      delirium tremens and one dead is the result of a Peruna intoxication which
      took place here a few days ago. C. E. Armstrong, of this place, and a
      party of three others started out on a camping trip to the Yellowstone
      country, taking with them several bottles of whisky and ten bottles of
      Peruna, which one of the members of the party was taking as a tonic. The
      trip lasted over a week. The whisky was exhausted and for two days the
      party was without liquor. At last some one suggested that they use Peruna,
      of which nine bottles remained. Before they stopped the whole remaining
      supply had been consumed and the four men were in a state of intoxication,
      the like of which they had never known before. Finally, one awoke with
      terrible cramps in his stomach and found his companions seemingly in an
      almost lifeless condition. Suffering terrible agony, he crawled on his
      hands and knees to a ranch over a mile distant, the process taking him
      half a day. Aid was sent to his three companions. Armstrong was dead when
      the rescue party arrived. The other two men, still unconscious, were
      brought to town in a wagon and are still in a weak and emaciated
      condition. Armstrong's body was almost tied in a knot and could not be
      straightened for burial."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is testimony from a druggist in a Southern "no license" town:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peruna is bought by all the druggists in this section by the gross. I
      have seen persons thoroughly intoxicated from taking Peruna. The common
      remark in this place when a drunken party is particularly obstreperous is
      that he is on a 'Peruna drunk,' It is a notorious fact that a great many
      do use Peruna to get the alcoholic effect, and they certainly do get it
      good and strong. Now, there are other so-called remedies used for the same
      purpose, namely, Gensenica, Kidney Specific, Jamaica Ginger, Hostetter's
      Bitters, etc."
    </p>
    <p>
      So well recognized is this use of the nostrum that a number of the
      Southern newspapers advertise a cure for the "Teruna habit." which is
      probably worse than the habit, as is usually the case with these "cures."
      In southern Ohio and in the mountain districts of West Virginia the
      "Peruna jag" is a standard form of intoxication.

    <h2>
      Two Testimonials.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A testimonial-hunter in the employ of the Peruna company was referred by a
      Minnesota druggist to a prosperous farmer in the neighborhood. The farmer
      gave Peruna a most enthusiastic "send-off"; he had been using it for
      several months and could say, etc. Then he took the agent to his barn and
      showed him a heap of empty Peruna bottles. The agent counted them. There
      were seventy-four. The druggist added his testimonial. "That old boy has a
      'still' on all the time since he discovered Peruna," said he. "He's my
      star customer." The druggist's testimonial was not printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time when certain Chicago drug stores were fighting some of the
      leading patent medicines, and carrying only a small stock of them, a boy
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p017.png">[017]</a></span>called
      one evening at one of the downtown shops for thirty-nine bottles of
      Peruna. "There's the money," he said. "The old man wants to get his before
      it's all gone." Investigation showed that the purchaser was the night
      engineer of a big downtown building and that the entire working staff had
      "chipped in" to get a supply of their favorite stimulant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should any one who wants to get drunk drink Peruna when he can
      get whisky?" argues the nostrum-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two reasons, one of which is that in many places the "medicine"
      can be obtained and the liquor can not. Maine, for instance, being a
      prohibition state, does a big business in patent medicines. So does
      Kansas. So do most of the no-license counties in the South, though a few
      have recently thrown out the disguised "boozes." Indiana Territory and
      Oklahoma, as we have seen, have done so because of Poor Lo's predilection
      toward curing himself of depression with these remedies, and for a time,
      at least, Peruna was shipped in in unlabeled boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      United States District Attorney Mellette, of the western district of
      Indian Territory, writes: "Vast quantities of Peruna are shipped into this
      country, and I have caused a number of persons to be indicted for selling
      the same, and a few of them have been convicted or have entered pleas of
      guilty. I could give you hundreds of specific cases of 'Peruna drunk'
      among the Indians. It is a common beverage among them, used for the
      purposes of intoxication."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other reason why Peruna or some other of its class is often the agency
      of drunkenness instead of whisky is that the drinker of Peruna doesn't
      want to get drunk, at least she doesn't know that she wants to get drunk.
      I use the feminine pronoun advisedly, because the remedies of this class
      are largely supported by women. Lydia Pinkham's variety of drink depends
      for its popularity chiefly on its alcohol. Paine's Celery Compound
      relieves depression and lack of vitality on the same principle that a
      cocktail does, and with the same necessity for repetition. I know an
      estimable lady from the middle West who visited her dissipated brother in
      New York&mdash;dissipated from her point of view, because she was a pillar
      of the W. C. T. U., and he frequently took a cocktail before dinner and
      came back with it on his breath, whereon she would weep over him as one
      lost to hope. One day, in a mood of brutal exasperation, when he hadn't
      had his drink and was able to discern the flavor of her grief, he turned
      on her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you what's the matter with you," he said. "You're drunk&mdash;maudlin
      drunk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She promptly and properly went into hysterics. The physician who attended
      diagnosed the case more politely, but to the same effect, and ascertained
      that she had consumed something like half a bottle of Kilmer's Swamp-Root
      that afternoon. Now, Swamp-Root is a very creditable "booze," but much
      weaker in alcohol than most of its class. The brother was greatly amused
      until he discovered, to his alarm, that his drink-abhorring sister
      couldn't get along without her patent medicine bottle! She was in a fair
      way, quite innocently, of becoming a drunkard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example of this "unconscious drunkenness" is recorded by the <i>Journal
      of the American Medical Association</i>: "A respected clergyman fell ill
      and the family physician was called. After examining the patient carefully
      the doctor asked for a private interview with the patient's adult son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I am sorry to tell you that your father undoubtedly is suffering from
      chronic alcoholism,' said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Chronic alcoholism! Why, that's ridiculous! Father never drank a drop of
      liquor in his life, and we know all there is to know about his habits.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, my boy, its chronic alcoholism, nevertheless, and at this present
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p018.png">[018]</a></span>moment
      your father is drunk. How has his health been recently? Has he been taking
      any medicine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, for some time, six months, I should say, father has often
      complained of feeling unusually tired. A few months ago a friend of his
      recommended Peruna to him, assuring him that it would build him up. Since
      then he has taken many bottles of it, and I am quite sure that he has
      taken nothing else.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      From its very name one would naturally absolve Duffy's Malt Whiskey from
      fraudulent pretence. But Duffy's Malt Whiskey is a fraud, for it pretends
      to be a medicine and to cure all kinds of lung and throat diseases. It is
      especially favored by temperance folk. "A dessertspoonful four to six
      times a day in water and a tablespoonful on going to bed" (personal
      prescription for consumptive), makes a fair grog allowance for an
      abstainer.

      THREE "DISTINGUISHED TEMPERANCE WORKERS" WHO ADVOCATE THE USE OF WHISKEY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these three "distinguished divines and temperance workers," the Rev.
      Dunham runs a Get-Married-Quick Matrimonial Bureau, while the "Rev."
      Houghton derives his income from his salary as Deputy Internal Revenue
      Collector, his business being to collect Uncle Sam's liquor tax. The
      printed portrait of Houghton is entirely Imaginary; a genuine photograph
      of the "temperance worker" and whiskey Indorser is shown above. The Rev.
      McLeod lives in Greenleaf, Mich.&mdash;a township of 893 inhabitants, in
      Salina County, north of Port Huron, and off the railway line. Mr. McLeod
      was called to trial by his presbytery for Indorsing Duffy's whiskey and
      was allowed to "resign" from the fellowship. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p020.png">[020]</a></span>It has testimonials ranging from
      consumption to malaria, and indorsements of the clergy. On the opposite
      page we reproduce a Duffy advertisement showing the "portraits" of three
      "clergymen" who consider Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey a gift of God, and on

      place behind the bar, being sold by the manufacturers to the wholesale
      liquor trade and by them to the saloons, where it may be purchased over
      the counter for 85 cents a quart. This is cheap, but Duffy's Pure Malt
      Whiskey, is not regarded as a high-class article.

    <h4>
      REV. W. N. DUNHAM.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Born in Vermont eighty-two years ago, Mr. Dunham was graduated from the
      Boston Medical College and practiced medicine until about thirty years
      ago, when he moved west. There he became a preacher. He occupied the
      pulpit of the South Cheyenne, Wyoming, Congregational Church for ten
      years. Two years ago he retired from the pulpit and established a marriage
      bureau for the accommodation of couples who come over from Colorado to be
      married. No money was paid by the Duffy's Malt Whiskey people for Dunham's
      testimonial; but he received about $10 "to have his picture taken."
    </p>
    <h4>
      "REV." M. N. HOUGHTON.
    </h4>
    <p>
      This Is the actual likeness of the "distinguished divine" with the side
      whiskers in the Duffy whiskey advertisement. Mr. Houghton was for a number
      of years pastor of the Church of Eternal Hope, of Bradford, Pa. He retired
      six years ago to enter politics, and is now a deputy Internal Revenue
      collector. Although a member of the Universalist Church, Mr. Houghton is a
      spiritualist and delivered orations last summer at the Lily Dale assembly,
      the spiritualistic "City of Light" located near Dunkirk, N. Y. Mr.
      Houghton owned racehorses and was a patron of the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its status has been definitely settled in New York State, where Excise
      Commissioner Cullinane recently obtained a decision in the supreme court
      declaring it a liquor. The trial was in Rochester, where the nostrum is
      made. Eleven supposedly reputable physicians, four of them members of the
      Health Department, swore to their belief that the whisky contained drugs
      which constituted it a genuine medicine. The state was able to show
      conclusively that if remedial drugs were present they were in such small
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p021.png">[021]</a></span>quantities
      as to be indistinguishable, and, of course, utterly without value; in
      short, that the product was nothing more or less than sweetened whisky.
      Yet the United States government has long lent its sanction to the
      "medicine" status by exempting Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey from the federal
      liquor tax. In fact, the government is primarily responsible for the
      formal establishment of the product as a medicine, having forced it into
      the patent medicine ranks at the time when the Spanish war expenses were
      partly raised by a special tax on nostrums. Up to that time the Duffy
      product, while asserting its virtues in various ills, made no direct
      pretence to be anything but a whisky. Transfer to the patent medicine list
      cost it, in war taxes, more than $40,000. By way of setting a <i>quid pro
      quo</i>, the company began ingeniously and with some justification to
      exploit its liquor as "the only whisky recognised by the government as
      medicine," and continues so to advertise, although the recent decision of
      the Internal Revenue Department, providing that all patent medicines which
      have no medicinal properties other than the alcohol in them must pay a
      rectifier's tax, relegates it to its proper place. While this decision is
      not a severe financial blow to the Duffys and their congeners (it means
      only a few hundred dollars apiece), it is important as officially
      establishing the "bracer" class on the same footing with whisky and gin,
      where they belong. Other "drugs" there are which sell largely, perhaps
      chiefly, over the oar, Hostetter's Bitters and Damiana Bitters being
      prominent in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this series of articles was first projected, <i>Collier's</i>
      received a warning from "Warner's Safe Cure," advising that a thorough
      investigation would be wise before "making any attack" on that
      preparation. I have no intention of "attacking" this company or any one
      else, and they would have escaped notice altogether, because of their
      present unimportance, but for their letter. The suggested investigation
      was not so thorough as to go deeply into the nature of the remedy, which
      is an alcoholic liquid, but it developed this interesting fact; Warner's
      Safe Cure, together with all the Warner remedies, is leased, managed and
      controlled by the New York and Kentucky Distilling Company, manufacturers
      of standard whiskies which do not pretend to remedy anything but thirst.
      Duffy's Malt Whiskey is an another subsidiary company of the New York and
      Kentucky concern. This statement is respectfully submitted to temperance
      users of the Malt Whiskey and the Warner remedies.

    <h2>
      Some Alcohol Percentages.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hostetter's Bitters contain, according to an official state analysis, 44
      per cent, of alcohol; Lydia Pinkham appeals to suffering womanhood with 20
      per cent, of alcohol; Hood's Sarsaparilla cures "that tired feeling" with
      18 per cent.; Burdock's Blood Bitters, with 25 per cent.; Ayer's
      Sarsaparilla, with 26 per cent., and Paine's Celery Compound, with 21 per
      cent. The fact is that any of these remedies could be interchanged with
      Peruna or with each other, so far as general effect goes, though the iodid
      of potassium in the sarsaparilla class might have some effect (as likely
      to be harmful as helpful ) which would be lacking in the simpler mixtures.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this class of nostrum is so harmful, asks the attentive reader of
      newspaper advertising columns, how explain the indorsements of so many
      people of prominence and reputation? "Men of prominence and reputation" in
      this connection means Peruna, for Peruna has made a specialty of high
      government officials and people in the public eye. In a self-gratulatory
      dissertation the Peruna Company observes in substance that, while the
      leading minds of the nation have hitherto shrunk from the publicity
      attendant on commending any patent medicine, the transcendent virtues of
      Peruna have overcome this amiable modesty, and, one and all, they stand
      forth its avowed champions. This is followed by an ingenious document
      headed <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p022.png">[022]</a></span>"Fifty
      Members of Congress Send Letters of Indorsement to the Inventor of the
      Great Catarrh Remedy, Pe-ru-na," and quoting thirty-six of the letters.
      Analysis of these letters brings out the singular circumstance that in
      twenty-one of the thirty-six there is no indication that the writer has
      ever tasted the remedy which he so warmly praises. As a sample, and for
      the benefit of lovers of ingenious literature, I reprint the following
      from a humorous member of Congress:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My secretary has as bad a case of catarrh as I ever saw, and since he has
      taken one bottle of Peruna he seems like a different man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taylorsville, N. C. Romulus Z. Linney."
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous letter of Admiral Schley is a case in point. He wrote to the
      Peruna Company:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can cheerfully say that Mrs. Schley has used Peruna, and, I believe,
      with good effect. [Signed] W. S. Schley."
    </p>
    <p>
      This indorsement went the rounds of the country in half-page blazonry, to
      the consternation of the family's friends. Admiral Schley seems to have
      appreciated that this use of his name was detrimental to his standing. He
      wrote to a Columbus religious journal the following letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      "1820 I Street, Washington, D. C., Nov. 10,1904. "<i>Editor Catholic
      Columbian</i>:&mdash;The advertisement of the Peruna Company, inclosed, is
      made without any authority or approval from me. When it was brought to my
      attention first I wrote the company a letter, stating that the
      advertisement was offensive and must be discontinued. Their representative
      here called on me and stated he had been directed to assure me no further
      publication would be allowed, as it was without my sanction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would say that the advertisement has been made without my knowledge or
      consent and is an infringement of my rights as a citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will kindly inform me what the name and date of the paper was in
      which the inclosed advertisement appeared I shall feel obliged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very truly yours, W. S. Schley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Careful study of this document will show that this is no explicit denial
      of the testimonial. But who gives careful study to such a letter? On the
      face of it, it puts the Peruna people in the position of having forged
      their advertisement. Ninety-nine people out of a hundred would get that
      impression. Yet I have seen the testimonial, signed with Admiral Schley's
      name and interlined in the same handwriting as the signature, and I have
      seen another letter, similarly signed, stating that Admiral Schley had not
      understood that the letter was to be used for such advertising as the
      recipient based on it. If these letters are forgeries the victim has his
      recourse in the law. They are on file at Columbus, Ohio, and the Peruna
      Company would doubtless produce them in defense of a suit.

      Twenty years ago the microbe was making a great stir in the land. The
      public mind, ever prone to exaggerate the importance and extent of any new
      scientific discovery, ascribed all known diseases to microbes. The
      infinitesimal creature with the mysterious and unpleasant attributes
      became the leading topic of the time. Shrewdly appreciating this golden
      opportunity, a quack genius named Radam invented a drug to slay the new
      enemy of mankind and gave it his name. Radam's Microbe Killer filled the
      public prints with blazonry of its lethal virtues. As it consisted of a
      mixture of muriatic and sulphuric acids with red wine, any microbe which
      took it was like to fare hard; but the ingenious Mr. Radam's method of
      administering it to its intended prey via the human stomach failed to
      commend itself to science, though enormously successful in a financial
      sense through flamboyant advertising.

      Liquozone "Cures" Thirty-seven Varieties.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In time some predaceous bacillus, having eluded the "killer," carried off
      its inventor. His nostrum soon languished. To-day it is little heard of,
      but from the ashes of its glories has risen a mightier successor,
      Liquozone. Where twenty years ago the microbe reveled in publicity, to-day
      we talk of germs and bacteria; consequently Liquozone exploits itself as a
      germicide and bactericide. It dispenses with the red wine of the Radam
      concoction and relies on a weak solution of sulphuric and sulphurous
      acids, with an occasional trace of hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid.
      Mostly it is water, and this is what it "cures":
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Asthma, Gallstones,
     Abscess&mdash;Anemia, Goiter&mdash;Gout;
     Bronchitis, Hay Fever&mdash;Influenza,
     Blood Poison, La Grippe,
     Bowel Troubles, Leucorrhea,

     Eczema&mdash;Erysipelas, Tumors&mdash;Ulcers,

</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;all diseases that begin with fever&mdash;all inflammations&mdash;all
      catarrh&mdash;all contagious diseases&mdash;all the results of impure or
      poisoned blood. In nervous diseases Liquozone acts as a vitalizer,
      accomplishing what no drugs can do."
    </p>
    <p>
      These diseases it conquers by destroying, in the human body, the germs
      which cause (or are alleged to cause) them. Such is Liquozone's claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the Liquozone Company is not a patent medicine concern. We have their
      own word for it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We wish to state at the start that we are not patent medicine men, and
      their methods will not be employed by us.... Liquozone is too important a
      product for quackery."
    </p>
    <p>
      The head and center of this non-patent medicine cure-all is Douglas Smith.
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p024.png">[024]</a></span>Mr.
      Smith is by profession a promoter. He is credited with a keen vision for
      profits. Several years ago he ran on a worthy ex-piano dealer, a Canadian
      by the name of Powley (we shall meet him again, trailing clouds of glory
      in a splendid metamorphosis), who was selling with some success a mixture
      known as Powley's Liquefied Ozone. This was guaranteed to kill any disease
      germ known to science. Mr. Smith examined into the possibilities of the
      product, bought out Powley, moved the business to Chicago and organized it
      as the Liquid Ozone Company. Liquid air was then much in the public
      prints. Mr. Smith, with the intuition of genius, and something more than
      genius' contempt for limitations, proceeded to catch the public eye with
      this frank assertion: "Liquozone is liquid oxygen&mdash;that is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is enough. That is, it would be enough if it were but true. Liquid
      oxygen doesn't exist above a temperature of 229 degrees below zero. One
      spoonful would freeze a man's tongue, teeth and throat to equal solidity
      before he ever had time to swallow. If he could, by any miracle, manage to
      get it down, the undertaker would have to put him on the stove to thaw him
      out sufficiently for a respectable burial. Unquestionably Liquozone, if it
      were liquid oxygen, would kill germs, but that wouldn't do the owner of
      the germs much good because he'd be dead before they had time to realize
      that the temperature was falling. That it would cost a good many dollars
      an ounce to make is, perhaps, beside the question. The object of the
      company was not to make money, but to succor the sick and suffering. They
      say so themselves in their advertising. For some reason, however, the
      business did not prosper as its new owner had expected. A wider appeal to
      the sick and suffering was needed. Claude C. Hopkins, formerly advertising
      manager for Dr. Shoop's Restorative (also a cure-all) and perhaps the
      ablest exponent of his specialty in the country, was brought into the
      concern and a record-breaking campaign was planned. This cost no little
      money, but the event proved it a good investment. President Smith's next
      move showed him to be the master of a silver tongue, for he persuaded the
      members of a very prominent law firm who were acting as the company's
      attorneys to take stock in the concern, and two of them to become
      directors. These gentlemen represent, in Chicago, something more than the
      high professional standing of their firm; they are prominent socially and
      forward in civic activities; in short, just the sort of people needed by
      President Smith to bulwark his dubious enterprise with assured
      respectability.

    <h2>
      The Men Who Back the Fake.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the Equitable scandal there has been plenty of evidence to show that
      directors often lend their names to enterprises of which they know
      practically nothing. This seems to have been the case with the lawyers.
      One point they brought up: was Liquozone harmful? Positively not, Douglas
      Smith assured them. On the contrary, it was the greatest boon to the sick
      in the world's history, and he produced an impressive bulk of
      testimonials. This apparently satisfied them; they did not investigate the
      testimonials, but accepted them at their face value. They did not look
      into the advertising methods of the company; as nearly as I can find out,
      they never saw an advertisement of Liquozone in the papers until long
      afterward. They just became stockholders and directors, that is all. They
      did as hundreds of other upright and well-meaning men had done in lending
      themselves to a business of which they knew practically nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the lawyers continued to practice law, Messrs. Smith and Hopkins
      were running the Liquozone Company. An enormous advertising campaign was
      begun. Pamphlets were issued containing testimonials and claiming <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p025.png">[025]</a></span>the soundest
      of professional backing. Indeed, this matter of expert testimony,
      chemical, medical and bacteriologic, is a specialty of Liquozone. Today,
      despite its reforms, it is supported by an ingenious system of
      pseudoscientific charlatanry. In justice to Mr. Hopkins it is but fair to
      say that he is not responsible for the basic fraud; that the general
      scheme was devised, and most of the bogus or distorted medical letters
      arranged, before his advent. But when I came to investigate the product a
      few months ago I found that the principal defense against attacks
      consisted of scientific statements which would not bear analysis and
      medical letters not worth the paper they were written on. In the first
      place, the Liquozone people have letters from chemists asseverating that
      the compound is chemically scientific.

    <h4>
      ANALYSIS OF LIQUOZONE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      SULPHURIC ACID &mdash; About nine-tenths of one per cent. SULPHUROUS ACID
      &mdash; About three-tenths of one per cent WATER....... &mdash; Nearly
      ninety-nine per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sulphuric acid is oil of vitriol. Sulphurous acid is also a corrosive
      poison. Liquozone is the combination of these two heavily diluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Dickman, Mackenzie &amp; Potter, of Chicago, furnish a statement
      to the effect that the product is "made up on scientific principles,
      contains no substance deleterious to health and is an antiseptic and
      germicide of the highest order." As chemists the Dickman firm stands high,
      but if sulphuric and sulphurous acids are not deleterious to their health
      there must be something peculiar about them as human beings. Mr. Deavitt
      of Chicago makes affidavit that the preparation is not made by compounding
      drugs. A St. Louis bacteriologist testifies that it will kill germs (in
      culture tubes), and that it has apparently brought favorable results in
      diarrhea, rheumatism and a finger which a guinea-pig had gnawed. These and
      other technical indorsements are set forth with great pomp and
      circumstance, but when analyzed they fail to bear out the claims of
      Liquozone as a medicine. Any past investigation into the nature of
      Liquozone has brought a flood of "indorsements" down on the investigator,
      many of them medical. My inquiries have been largely along medical lines,
      because the makers of the drug claim the private support of many
      physicians and medical institutions, and such testimony is the most
      convincing. "Liquozone has the indorsement of an overwhelming number of
      medical authorities," says one of the pamphlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the inclosures sent to me was a letter from a young physician on
      the staff of the Michael Reese Hospital, Chicago, who was paid $25 to make
      bacteriologic tests in pure cultures. He reported: "This is to certify
      that the fluid Liquozone handed to me for bacteriologic examination has
      shown bacteriologic and germicidal properties." At the same time he <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p026.png">[026]</a></span>informed the
      Liquozone agent that the mixture would be worthless medicinally. He writes
      me as follows: "I have never used or indorsed Liquozone; furthermore, its
      action would be harmful when taken internally. Can report a case of
      gastric ulcer due probably to its use."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in my investigations I came on this certificate again. It was
      quoted, in a report on Liquozone, made by the head of a prominent Chicago
      laboratory for a medical journal, and it was designated "Report made by
      the Michael Reese Hospital," without comment or investigation. This
      surprising garbling of the facts may have been due to carelessness, or it
      may have some connection with the fact that the laboratory investigation
      was about that time employed to do work for Mr. Douglas Smith, Liquozone's
      president.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another document is an enthusiastic "puff" of Liquozone, quoted as being
      contributed by Dr. W. H. Myers in <i>The New York Journal of Health</i>.
      There is not nor ever has been any such magazine as <i>The New York
      Journal of Health</i>. Dr. W. H. Myers, or some person masquerading under
      that name, got out a bogus "dummy" (for publication only, and not as
      guarantee of good faith) at a small charge to the Liquozone people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For convenience I list several letters quoted or sent to me, with the
      result of investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Suffolk Hospital and Dispensary of Boston, through its president,
      Albert C. Smith, writes: "Our test shows it (Liquozone) to possess great
      remedial value." The letter I have found to be genuine. But the hospital
      <i>medical</i> authorities say that they know nothing of Liquozone and
      never prescribe it. If President Smith is prescribing it he is liable to
      arrest, as he is not an M.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      A favoring letter from "Dr." Fred W. Porter of Tampa, Fla., is quoted. The
      Liquozone recipients of the letter forgot to mention that "Dr." Porter is
      not an M.D., but a veterinary surgeon, as is shown by his letter head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. George E. Bliss of Maple Rapids, Mich., has used Liquozone for cancer
      patients. Dr. Bliss writes me, under the flaming headline of his "cancer
      cure," that his letter is genuine and "not solicitated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. A. A. Bell of Madison, Ga., is quoted as saying: "I found Liquozone to
      invigorate digestion." He is <i>not</i> quoted (although he wrote it) as
      saying that his own personal experience with it had shown it to be
      ineffective. I have seen the original letter, and the unfavorable part of
      it was blue-penciled.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a local indorsement of any medicine perhaps as strong a name as could
      be secured in Chicago is that of Dr. Frank Billings. In the offices of <i>Collier's</i>
      and elsewhere Dr. Billings has been cited by the Liquozone people as one
      of those medical men who were prevented only by ethical considerations
      from publicly indorsing their nostrum, but who, nevertheless, privately
      avowed confidence in it. Here is what Dr. Billings has to say of this:
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicago, Ill., July 31, 1905.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To the Editor of Collier's Weekly.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;I have never recommended Liquozone in any way to
      any one, nor have I expressed to any representative of the Liquozone
      Company, or to any other person, an opinion favorable to Liquozone.
      (Signed)
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Billings, M.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the heading, "Some Chicago Institutions which Constantly Employ
      Liquozone," are cited Hull House, the Chicago Orphan Asylum, the Home for
      Incurables, the Evanston Hospital and the Old People's Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters to the institutions elicited the information that Hull House <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p027.png">[027]</a></span>had never used
      the nostrum, and had protested against the statement; that the Orphan
      Asylum had experimented with it only for external applications, and with
      such dubious results that it was soon dropped; that it had been shut out
      of the Home for Incurables; that a few private patients in the Old
      People's Home had purchased it, but on no recommendation from the
      physicians; and that the Evanston Hospital knew nothing of Liquozone and
      had never used it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a professional interest in the "overwhelming number of medical
      indorsements" claimed by Liquozone, a Chicago physician, Dr. W. H. Felton,
      went to the company's offices and asked to see the medical evidence. None
      was forthcoming; the lists, he was informed, were in the press and could
      not be shown. He then asked for the official book for physicians
      advertised by the firm, containing "a great deal of evidence from
      authorities whom all physicians respect." This also, they said, was "in
      the press." As a matter of fact, it has never come out of the press and
      never will; the special book project has been dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more claim and I am done with the "scientific evidence." In a pamphlet
      issued by the company and since withdrawn occurs this sprightly sketch:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liquozone is the discovery of Professor Pauli, the great German chemist,
      who worked for twenty years to learn how to liquefy oxygen. When Pauli
      first mentioned his purpose men laughed at him. The idea of liquefying gas&mdash;of
      circulating a liquid oxygen in the blood&mdash;seemed impossible. But
      Pauli was one of those men who set their whole hearts on a problem and
      follow it out either to success or to the grave. So Pauli followed out
      this problem though it took twenty years. He clung to it through
      discouragements which would have led any lesser man to abandon it. He
      worked on it despite poverty and ridicule," etc.

    <h2>
      Liquozone Kills a Great German Scientist.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alas for romance! The scathing blight of the legal mind descended on this
      touching story. The lawyer-directors would have none of "Professor Pauli,
      the great German chemist," and Liquozone destroyed him, as it had created
      him. Not totally destroyed, however, for from those rainbow wrappings, now
      dissipated, emerges the humble but genuine figure of our old acquaintance,
      Mr. Powley, the ex-piano man of Toronto. He is the prototype of the
      Teutonic savant. So much the Liquozone people now admit, with the defence
      that the change of Powley to Pauli was, at most, a harmless flight of
      fancy, "so long as we were not attempting to use a name famous in medicine
      or bacteriology in order to add prestige to the product." A plea which
      commends itself by its ingeniousness at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gone is "Professor Pauli," and with him much of his kingdom lies. In fact,
      I believe there is no single definite intentional misstatement in the new
      Liquozone propaganda. For some months there has been a cessation of all
      advertising, and an overhauling of materials under the censorship of the
      lawyer-directors, who were suddenly aroused to the real situation by a
      storm of protest and criticism, and, rather late in the day, began to "sit
      up and take notice." The company has recently sent me a copy of the new
      booklet on which all their future advertising is to be based. The most
      important of their fundamental misstatements to go by the board is
      "Liquozone is liquid oxygen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liquozone contains no free oxygen," declares the revision frankly. No
      testimonials are to be printed. The faked and garbled letters are to be
      dropped from the files. There is no claim of "overwhelming medical
      indorsement." Nor is the statement <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p028.png">[028]</a></span>anywhere made that Liquozone will
      cure any of the diseases in which it is recommended. Yet such is the
      ingenuity with which the advertising manager has presented his case that
      the new newspaper exploitation appeals to the same hopes and fears, with
      the same implied promises, as the old. "I'm well because of Liquozone," in
      huge type, is followed by the list of diseases "where it applies." And the
      new list is more comprehensive than the old.

      All Ills Look Alike to Liquozone.
    </h2>
    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Just as to Peruna all ills are catarrh, so to Liquozone every disease is a
      germ disease. Every statement in the new prospectus of cure "has been
      submitted to competent authorities, and is exactly true and correct.,"
      declares the recently issued pamphlet, "Liquozone, and Tonic Germicide";
      and the pamphlet goes on to ascribe, among other ills, asthma, gout,
      neuralgia, dyspepsia, goiter and "most forms of kidney, liver and heart
      troubles" to germs. I don't know just which of the eminent authorities who
      have been working for the Liquozone Company fathers this remarkable and
      epoch-making discovery. <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p029.png">[029]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the writer of the Liquozone pamphlet, and the experts who
      edited it, got a little mixed on their germs in the matter of malaria.
      "Liquozone is deadly to vegetable natter, but helpful to animals,"
      declares the pamphlet.... "Germs are vegetables"&mdash;and that is the
      reason that Liquozone kills them. But malaria, which Liquozone is supposed
      to cure, is positively known to be due to animal organisms in the blood,
      not vegetable. Therefore, if the claims are genuine, liquozone, being
      "helpful to animals," will aid and abet the malaria organism in his
      nefarious work, and the Liquozone Company, as well-intentioned men,
      working in the interests of health, ought to warn all sufferers of this
      class from use of their animal-stimulator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old claim is repeated that nothing enters into the production of
      Liquozone but gases, water and a little harmless coloring matter, and that
      the process requires large apparatus and from eight to fourteen days'
      time. I have seen the apparatus, consisting of huge wooden vats, and can
      testify to their impressive size. And I have the assurance of several
      gentlemen whose word (except in print) I am willing to take, that fourteen
      days' time is employed in impregnating every output of liquid with gas.
      The result, so far as can be determined chemically or medicinally, is
      precisely the same as could be achieved in fourteen seconds by mixing the
      acids with the water. The product is still sulphurous and sulphuric acid
      heavily diluted, that is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will the compound destroy germs in the human body? This is, after all, the
      one overwhelmingly important point for determination; for if it will, all
      the petty fakers and forgery, the liquid oxygen and Professor Pauli and
      the mythical medical journalism may be forgiven. For more than four months
      now <i>Collier's</i> has been patiently awaiting some proof of the
      internal germicidal qualities of Liquozone None has been forthcoming
      except specious generalities from scientific employés of the company&mdash;and
      testimonials. The value of testimonials as evidence is considered in a
      later article. Liquozone's are not more convincing than others. Of the
      chemists and bacteriologists employed by the Liquozone Company there is
      not one who will risk his professional reputation on the simple and
      essential statement that Liquozone taken internally kills germs in the
      human system. One experiment has been made by Mr. Schoen of Chicago, which
      I am asked to regard as indicating in some degree a deterrent action of
      Liquozone on the disease of anthrax. Of two guinea-pigs inoculated with
      anthrax, one which was dosed with Liquozone survived the other, not thus
      treated, by several hours. Bacteriologists employed by us to make a
      similar test failed, because of the surprising fact that the dose as
      prescribed by Mr. Schoen promptly killed the first guinea-pig to which it
      was administered. A series of guinea-pig tests was then arranged (the
      guinea-pig is the animal which responds to germ infection most nearly as
      the human organism responds), at which Dr. Gradwohl, representing the
      Liquozone Company, was present, and in which he took part. The report
      follows: <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p030.png">[030]</a></span>

      Anthrax Test. Twenty-four guinea-pigs were inoculated with anthrax
      bacilli, under the same conditions, the same amount being given to each.
      The representative of the Liquozone people selected the twelve pigs for
      treatment. These animals were given Liquozone is 5 c.c. doses for three
      hours. In twenty-four hours all pigs were dead&mdash;the treated and the
      untreated ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Anthrax Test. Eight guinea-pigs were Inoculated under the same
      conditions with a culture of anthrax sent by the Liquozone people. Four of
      these animals were treated for three hours with Liquozone as in the last
      experiment. These died also in from thirty-six to forty-eight hours, as
      did the remaining four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diphtheria Test. Six guinea-pigs were inoculated with diphtheria bacilli
      and treated with Liquozone. They all died in from forty-eight to
      seventy-two hours. Two out of three controls (i. e., untreated
      guinea-pigs) remained alive after receiving the same amount of culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuberculosis Test. Eight guinea-pigs were inoculated with tubercle
      bacilli. Four of these animals were treated for eight hours with 5 c.c. of
      a 20 per cent, solution of Liquozole. Four received no Liquozone. At the
      end of twenty-four days all the animals were killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairly developed tuberculosis was present in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize, we would say that the Liquozone had absolutely no curative
      effect, but did, when given in pure form, lower the resistance of the
      animals, so that they died a little earlier than those not treated.

    <p>
      By Ernst J. Lederle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gradwohl, representing the Liquozone Company, stated that he was
      satisfied of the fairness of the tests. He further declared that in his
      opinion the tests had proved satisfactorily the total ineffectiveness of
      Liquozone as an internal germicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these experiments show more than that. They show that in so far as
      Liquozone has any effect, it tends to lower the resistance of the body to
      an invading disease. That is, in the very germ diseases for which it is
      advocated, <i>Liquozone may decrease the chances of the patient's recovery
      with every dose that is swallowed, but certainly would not increase them</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its own field Liquozone is <i>sui generis</i>. On the ethical side,
      however, there are a few "internal germicides," and one of these comes in
      for mention here, not that it is in the least like Liquozone in its
      composition, but because by its monstrous claims it challenges comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the announcement of this article, and before, <i>Collier's</i> has
      been in receipt of much virtuous indignation from a manufacturer of
      remedies which, he claims, Liquozone copies. Charles Marchand has been the
      most active enemy of the Douglas Smith product. He has attacked the makers
      in print, organized a society, and established a publication mainly
      devoted to their destruction, and circulated far and wide injurious
      literature (most of it true) about their product. Of the relative merits
      of Hydrozone, Glycozone (Marchand's products); and Liquozone, I know
      nothing; but I know that the Liquozone Company has never in its history
      put forth so shameful an advertisement as the one reproduced on page 28,
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p028.png">[028]</a></span>
      signed by Marchand, and printed in the New Orleans <i>States</i> when the
      yellow-fever scare was at its height. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p031.png">[031]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hydrozone is an "ethical" remedy; its advertisements are to be found
      in reputable medical journals.

    <h2>
      The Same Old Fake.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Partly by reason of Marchand's energy, no nostrum in the country has been
      so widely attacked as the Chicago product. Occasional deaths, attributed
      (in some cases unjustly) to its use, have been made the most of, and
      scores of analyses have been printed, so that in all parts of the country
      the true nature of the nostrum is beginning to be understood. The
      prominence of its advertising and the reckless breadth of its claims have
      made it a shining mark. North Dakota has forbidden its sale. San Francisco
      has decreed against it; so has Lexington, Ky., and there are signs that it
      will have a fight tor its life soon in other cities. It is this looming
      danger that impelled Liquozone to an attempted reform last summer. Yet, in
      spite of the censorship of its legal lights, in spite of the revision of
      its literature by its scientific experts, in spite of its ingenious
      avoidance of specifically false claims in the advertising which is being
      scattered broadcast to-day, Liquozone is now what it was before its
      rehabilitation, a fraud which owes its continued existence to the laxity
      of our public health methods and the cynical tolerance of the national
      conscience.

      Reprinted from Collier's Weekly, Dec. 2, 1006. <span class="pagenum"><a

    </h4>
    <p>
      Ignorance and credulous hope make the market for most proprietary
      remedies. Intelligent people are not given largely to the use of the
      glaringly advertised cure-alls, such as Liquozone or Peruna. Nostrums
      there are, however, which reach the thinking classes as well as the
      readily gulled. Depending, as they do, for their success on the lure of
      some subtle drug concealed under a trademark name, or some opiate not
      readily obtainable under its own label, these are the most dangerous of
      all quack medicines, not only in their immediate effect, but because they
      create enslaving appetites, sometimes obscure and difficult of treatment,
      most often tragically obvious. Of these concealed drugs the headache
      powders are the most widely used, and of the headache powders Orangeine is
      the most conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orangeine prints its formula. It is, therefore, its proprietors claim, not
      a secret remedy. But to all intents and purposes it is secret, because to
      the uninformed public the vitally important word "acetanilid" in the
      formula means little or nothing. Worse than its secrecy is its policy of
      careful and dangerous deception. Orangeine, like practically all the
      headache powders, is simply a mixture of acetanilid with less potent
      drugs. Of course, there is no orange in it, except the orange hue of the
      boxes and wrappers which is its advertising symbol. But this is an
      unimportant deception. The wickedness of the fraud lies in this: that
      whereas the nostrum, by virtue of its acetanilid content, thins the blood,
      depresses the heart and finally undermines the whole system, it claims <i>to
      strengthen the heart and to produce better blood</i>. Thus far in the
      patent medicine field I have not encountered so direct and specific an
      inversion of the true facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent years have added to the mortality records of our cities a
      surprising and alarming number of sudden deaths from heart failure. In the
      year 1902 New York City alone reported a death rate from this cause of
      1.34 per thousand of population; that is about six times as great as the
      typhoid fever death record. It was about that time that the headache
      powders were being widely advertised, and there is every reason to believe
      that the increased mortality, which is still in evidence, is due largely
      to the secret weakening of the heart by acetanilid. Occasionally a death
      occurs so definitely traceable to this poison that there is no room for
      doubt, as in the following report by Dr. J. L. Miller, of Chicago, in the
      <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, on the death of Mrs.
      Frances Robson:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was first called to see the patient, a young lady, physically sound,
      who had been taking Orangeine powders for a number of weeks for insomnia.
      The rest of the family noticed that she was very blue, and for this reason
      I was called. When I saw the patient she complained of a sense of
      faintness and inability to keep warm. At this time she had taken a box of
      six Orangeine powders within about eight hours. She was warned of the
      danger of continuing the indiscriminate use of the remedy, but insisted
      that many of her friends had used it and claimed that it was harmless. The
      family promised to see that she did not obtain any more of the remedy.
      Three days later, however, I was called to the house and found the patient
      dead. The family said that she had gone to her room the evening before in
      her usual health. The next morning, the patient not appearing, they
      investigated and found her dead. The case was reported to the coroner, and
      the coroner's verdict was: 'Death was from the effect of an overdose of
      Orangeine <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p033.png">[033]</a></span>powders
      administered by her own hand, whether accidentally or otherwise, unknown
      to the jury.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Last July an 18-year-old Philadelphia girl got a box of Orangeine powders
      at a drug store, having been told that they would cure headache. There was
      nothing on the label or in the printed matter inclosed with the
      preparation warning her of the dangerous character of the nostrum.
      Following the printed advice, she took two powders. In three hours she was
      dead. Coroner Dugan's verdict follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary A. Bispels came to her death from kidney and heart disease,
      aggravated by poisoning by acetanilid taken in Orangeine headache
      powders."

    <h2>
      Prescribing Without Authority.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yet this poison is being recommended every day by people who know nothing
      of it and nothing of the susceptibility of the friends to whom they
      advocate it. For example, here is a testimonial from the Orangeine
      booklet:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss A. A. Phillips, 60 Powers street, Brooklyn, writes: 'I always keep
      Orangeine in my desk at school, and through its frequent applications to
      the sick I am called both "doctor and magician."'"
    </p>
    <p>
      If the school herein referred to is a public school, the matter is one for
      the Board of Education; if a private school, for the Health Department or
      the county medical society. That a school teacher should be allowed to
      continue giving, however well meaning her foolhardiness may be, a harmful
      and possibly fatal dose to the children intrusted to her care seems rather
      a significant commentary on the quality of watchfulness in certain
      institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obscurity as to the real nature of the drug, fostered by careful
      deception, is the safeguard of the acetanilid vender. Were its perilous
      quality known, the headache powder would hardly be so widely used. And
      were the even more important fact that the use of these powders becomes a
      habit, akin to the opium or cocain habits, understood by the public, the
      repeated sales which are the basis of Orangeine's prosperity would
      undoubtedly be greatly cut down. Orangeine fulfills the prime requisite of
      a patent medicine in being a good "repeater." Did it not foster its own
      demand in the form of a persistent craving, it would hardly be profitable.
      Its advertising invites to the formation of an addiction to the drug. "Get
      the habit," it might logically advertise, in imitation of a certain
      prominent exploitation along legitimate lines. Not only is its value as a
      cure for nervousness and headaches insisted on, but its prospective dupes
      are advised to take this powerful drug as a <i>bracer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When, as often, you reach home tired in body and mind... take an
      Orangeine powder, lie down for thirty minutes' nap&mdash;if possible&mdash;anyway,
      relax, then take another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To induce sleep, take an Orangeine powder immediately before retiring.
      When wakeful, an Orangeine powder will have a normalizing, quieting
      effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also recommended as a good thing to begin the day's work on in the
      morning&mdash;that is, take Orangeine night, morning and between meals!
    </p>
    <p>
      These powders pretend to cure asthma, biliousness, headaches, colds,
      catarrh and grip (dose: powder every four hours during the day for a week!&mdash;a
      pretty fair start on the Orangeine habit), diarrhea, hay fever, insomnia,
      influenza, neuralgia, seasickness and sciatica.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, they do not cure any of these; they do practically nothing but
      give temporary relief by depressing the heart. With the return to normal
      conditions of blood circulation comes a recurrence of the nervousness,
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p034.png">[034]</a></span>headache,
      or what not, and the incentive to more of the drug, until it becomes a
      necessity. In my own acquaintance I know half a dozen persons who have
      come to depend on one or another of these headache preparations to keep
      them going. One young woman whom I have in mind told me quite innocently
      that she had been taking five or six Orangeine powders a day for several
      months, having changed from Koehler's powders when some one told her that
      the latter were dangerous! Because of her growing paleness her husband had
      called in their physician, but neither of them had mentioned the little
      matter of the nostrum, having accepted with a childlike faith the
      asseverations of its beneficent qualities. Yet they were of an order of
      intelligence that would scoff at the idea of drinking Swamp-Root.

      An Acetanilid Death Record.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This list of fatalities is made up from statements published in the
      newspapers. In every case the person who died had taken to relieve a
      headache or as a bracer a patent medicine containing acetanilid, without a
      doctor's prescription. This list does not include the case of a dog in
      Altoona, Pa., which died immediately on eating some sample headache
      powders. The dog did not know any better.

      Some of these victims died from an alleged overdose; others from the
      prescribed dose. In almost every instance the local papers suppressed the
      name of the fatal remedy, <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p035.png">[035]</a></span>Peruna.
      That particular victim had the beginning of the typical blue skin pictured
      in the street-car advertisements of Orangeine (the advertisements are a
      little mixed, as they put the blue hue on the "before taking," whereas it
      should go on the "after taking"). And, by the way, I can conscientiously
      recommend Orangeine, Koehler's powders, Royal Pain powders and others of
      that class to women who wish for a complexion of a dead, pasty white,
      verging to a puffy blueness under the eyes and about the lips. Patient use
      of these drugs will even produce an interesting and picturesque, if not
      intrinsically beautiful, purplish-gray hue of the face and neck.

    <h2>
      Drugs That Deprave.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Another acquaintance writes me that he is unable to dissuade his wife from
      the constant use of both Orangeine and Bromo-Seltzer, although her <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p036.png">[036]</a></span>health is
      breaking down. Often it is difficult for a physician to diagnose these
      cases because the symptoms are those of certain diseases in which the
      blood deteriorates, and, moreover, the victim, as in opium and cocain
      slavery, will positively deny having used the drug. A case of acetanilid
      addiction (in "cephalgin," an ethical proprietary) is thus reported:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the drug was withheld the patient soon began to exhibit all the
      traits peculiar to the confirmed morphine-maniac&mdash;moral depravity and
      the like. She employed every possible means to obtain the drug, attempting
      even to bribe the nurse, and, this failing, even members of the family."
      Another report of a similar case (and there are plenty of them to select
      from) reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stomach increasingly irritable; skin a grayish or light purplish hue;
      palpitation and slight enlargement of the heart; great prostration, with
      pains in the region of the heart; blood discolored to a chocolate hue. The
      patient denied that she had been using acetanilid, but it was discovered
      that for a year she had been obtaining it in the form of a proprietary
      remedy and had contracted a regular 'habit.' On the discontinuance of the
      drug the symptoms disappeared. She was discharged from the hospital as
      cured, but soon returned to the use of the drug and applied for
      readmission, displaying the former symptoms."

    <h2>
      On a cocain-laden medicine.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Where I have found a renegade physician making his millions out of Peruna,
      or a professional promoter trading on the charlatanry of Liquozone, it has
      seemed superfluous to comment on the personality of the men. They are what
      their business connotes. With Orangeine the case is somewhat different.
      Its proprietors are men of standing in other and reputable spheres of
      activity. Charles L. Bartlett, its president, is a graduate of Yale
      University and a man of some prominence in its alumni affairs. Orangeine
      is a side issue with him. Professionally he is the western representative
      of Ivory Soap, one of the heaviest of legitimate advertisers, and he
      doubtless learned from this the value of skillful exploitation. Next to
      Mr. Bartlett, the largest owner of stock (unless he has recently sold out)
      is William Gillette, the actor, whose enthusiastic indorsement of the
      powders is known in a personal sense to the profession which he follows,
      and in print to hundreds of thousands of theater-goers who have read it in
      their programs. Whatever these gentlemen may think of their product (and I
      understand that, incredible as it may seem, both of them are constant
      users of it and genuine believers in it), the methods by which it is sold
      and the essential and mendacious concealment of its real nature illustrate
      the <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p037.png">[037]</a></span>level
      to which otherwise upright and decent men are brought by a business which
      can not profitably include either uprightness or decency in its methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orangeine is less dangerous, except in extent of use, than many other
      acetanilid mixtures which are much the same thing under a different name.
      A friend of mine with a weak heart took the printed dose of Laxative Bromo
      Quinin and lay at the point of death for a week. There is no word of
      warning on the label. In many places samples of headache powders are
      distributed on the doorsteps. The St. Louis Chronicle records a result:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huntington, W. Va., Aug. 15, 1905.&mdash;While Mrs. Thomas Patterson was
      preparing supper last evening she was stricken with a violent headache and
      took a headache powder that had been thrown in at her door the day before.
      Immediately she was seized with spasms and in an hour she was dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      That even the lower order of animals is not safe is shown by a canine
      tragedy in Altoona, Pa., where a prize collie dog incautiously devoured
      three sample tablets and died in an hour. Yet the distributing agents of
      these mixtures do not hesitate to lie about them. Rochester, N. Y., has an
      excellent ordinance forbidding the distribution of sample medicines,
      except by permission of the health officer. An agent for Miniature
      Headache Powders called on Dr. Goler with a request for leave to
      distribute 25,000 samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your formula?" asked the official.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Salicylate of soda and sugar of milk," replied the traveling man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you pretend to cure headaches with that?" said the doctor. "I'll look
      into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysis showed that the powders were an acetanilid mixture. The sample
      man didn't wait for the result. He hasn't been back to Rochester since,
      although Dr. Goler is hopefully awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bromo-Seltzer is commonly sold in drug stores, both by the bottle and at
      soda fountains. The full dose is "a heaping teaspoonful." A heaping
      teaspoonful of Bromo-Seltzer means about ten grains of acetanilid. The
      United States Pharmacopeia dose is four grains; five grains have been
      known to produce fatal results. The prescribed dose of Bromo-Seltzer is
      dangerous and has been known to produce sudden collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Megrimine is a warranted headache cure that is advertised in several of
      the magazines. A newly arrived guest at a Long Island house party brought
      along several lots and distributed them as a remedy for headache and that
      tired feeling. It was perfectly harmless, she declared; didn't the
      advertisement say "leaves no unpleasant effects"? As a late dance the
      night before had left its impress on the feminine members of the house
      party, there was a general acceptance of the "bracer." That night the
      local physician visited the house party (on special "rush" invitation),
      and was well satisfied to pull all his patients through. He had never
      before seen acetanilid poisoning by wholesale. A Chicago druggist writes
      me that the wife of a prominent physician buys Megrimine of him by the
      half-dozen lots secretly. She has the habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      On October 9, W. H. Hawkins, superintendent of the American Detective
      Association, a mar of powerful physique and apparently in good health,
      went to a drug store in Anderson, Ind., and took a dose of Dr. Davis'
      Headache Powders. He then boarded a car for Marion and shortly after fell
      to the floor, dead. The coroner's verdict is reproduced on page 35. <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p035.png">[035]</a></span> Whether these
      powders are made by a Dr. W. C. Davis, of Indianapolis, who makes
      Anti-Headache, I am unable to state. Anti-Headache describes itself as "a
      compound of mild ingredients and positively contains no dangerous drugs."
      It is almost pure acetanilid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the "ethical" field the harm done by this class of proprietaries is
      perhaps <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p038.png">[038]</a></span>as
      great as in the open field, for many of those which are supposed to be
      sold only in prescriptions are as freely distributed to the laity as
      Peruna. And their advertising is hardly different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antikamnia, claiming to be an "ethical" remedy, and advertising through
      the medical press by methods that would, with little alteration, fit any
      patent painkiller on the market, is no less dangerous or fraudulent than
      the Orangeine class which it almost exactly parallels in composition. It
      was at first exploited as a "new synthetical coal-tar derivative," which
      it isn't and never was. It is simply half or more acetanilid (some
      analyses show as high as 68 per cent.) with other unimportant ingredients
      in varying proportions. In a booklet entitled "Light on Pain," and
      distributed on doorsteps, I find under an alphabetical list of diseases
      this invitation to form the Antikamnia habit:
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p038.png">[038]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      "Nervousness (overwork and excesses)&mdash;Dose: One Antikamnia tablet
      every two or three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoppers' or Sightseers' Headache&mdash;Dose: Two Antikamnia tablets
      every three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worry (nervousness, 'the blues')&mdash;Dose: One or two Antikamnia and
      Codein tablets every three hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Codein is obtained from opium. The codein habit is well known to all
      institutions which treat drug addictions, and is recognized as being no
      less difficult to cure than the morphin habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following well-known "remedies" both "ethical" and "patent," depend
      for their results upon the heart-depressing action of Acetanilid:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Orangeine
     Bromo-Seltzer
     Megrimine
     Anti-Headache
     Ammonol
     Salacetin
     Royal Pain Powders Dr. Davis's Headache Phenalgin
     Cephalgin
     Miniature Headache Powders
     Powders
</pre>
    <p>
      A typical instance of what Antikamnia will do for its users is that of a
      Pennsylvania merchant, 50 years old, who had declined, without apparent
      Antikamnia <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p039.png">[039]</a></span>cause,
      from 140 to 116 pounds, and was finally brought to Philadelphia in a state
      of stupor. His pulse was barely perceptible, his skin dusky and his blood
      of a deep chocolate color. On reviving he was questioned as to whether he
      had been taking headache powders. He had, for several years. What kind?
      Antikamnia; sometimes in the plain tablets, at other times Antikamnia with
      codein. How many? About twelve a day. He was greatly surprised to learn
      that this habit was responsible for his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My doctor gave it to me for insomnia," he said, and it appeared that the
      patient had never even been warned of the dangerous character of the drug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it obtainable, I would print here the full name and address of that
      attending physician, as one unfit, either through ignorance or
      carelessness, to practice his profession. And there would be other
      physicians all over the country who would, under that description, suffer
      the same indictment within their own minds for starting innocent patients
      on a destructive and sometimes fatal course. For it is the careless or
      conscienceless physician who gets the customer for the "ethical" headache
      remedies, and the customer, once secured, pays a profit, very literally,
      with his own blood. Once having taken Antikamnia, the layman, unless
      informed as to its true nature, will often return to the drug store and
      purchase it with the impression that it is a specific drug, like quinin or
      potassium chlorate, instead of a disguised poison, exploited and sold
      under patent rights by a private concern. The United States Postoffice, in
      its broad tolerance, permits the Antikamnia company to send through the
      mails little sample boxes containing tablets enough to kill an ordinary
      man, and these samples are sent not only to physicians, as is the rule
      with ethical remedies, but to lawyers, business men, "brain workers" and
      other prospective purchasing classes. The box bears the lying statement:
      "No drug habit&mdash;no heart effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as this is going to press the following significant case comes in
      from Iowa:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farmington, Iowa, Oct. 6.&mdash; (Special to the Constitution-Democrat.)&mdash;Mrs.
      Hattie Kick, one of the best and most prominent ladies of Farmington, died
      rather suddenly Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock from an overdose of
      Antikamnia, which she took for a severe headache from which she was
      suffering. Mrs. Kick was subject to severe headaches and was a frequent
      user of Antikamnia, her favorite remedy for this ailment."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is but one safeguard in the use of these remedies: to regard them as
      one would regard opium and to employ them only with the consent of a
      physician who understands their true nature. Acetanilid has its uses, but
      not as a generic painkiller. Pain is a symptom; you can drug it away
      temporarily, but it will return clamoring for more payment until the final
      price is hopeless enslavement. Were the skull and bones on every box of
      this class of poison the danger would be greatly minimized.
    </p>
    <p>
      With opium and cocain the case is different. The very words are danger
      signals. Legal restrictions safeguard the public, to a greater or less
      degree, from their indiscriminate use. Normal people do not knowingly take
      opium or its derivatives except with the sanction of a physician, and
      there is even spreading abroad a belief (surely an expression of the
      primal law of self-preservation) that the licensed practitioner leans too
      readily toward the convenient narcotics.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this perilous stuff is the ideal basis for a patent medicine because
      its results are immediate (though never permanent), and it is its own best
      advertisement in that one dose imperatively calls for another. Therefore
      it behooves the manufacturer of opiates to disguise the use of the drug.
      This he does in varying forms, and he has found his greatest success in
      the "cough and consumption cures" and the soothing syrup class. The former
      of these will be considered in another article. As to the "soothing
      syrups," <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p040.png">[040]</a></span>designed
      for the drugging of helpless infants, even the trade does not know how
      many have risen, made their base profit and subsided. A few survive,
      probably less harmful than the abandoned ones, on the average, so that by
      taking the conspicuous survivors as a type I am at least doing no
      injustice to the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years ago I heard a prominent New York lawyer, asked by his office
      scrub woman to buy a ticket for some "association" ball, say to her: "How
      can you go to these affairs, Nora, when you have two young children at
      home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, they're all right," she returned, blithely; "just wan teaspoonful
      of Winslow's an' they lay like the dead till mornin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      What eventually became of the scrub woman's children I don't know. The
      typical result of this practice is described by a Detroit physician who
      has been making a special study of Michigan's high mortality rate:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup is extensively used among the poorer
      classes as a means of pacifying their babies. These children eventually
      come into the hands of physicians with a greater or less addiction to the
      opium habit. The sight of a parent drugging a helpless infant into a
      semi-comatose condition is not an elevating one for this civilized age,
      and it is a very common practice. IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p040.png">[040]</a></span>I can give you one illustration
      from my own hospital experience, which was told me by the father of the
      girl. A middle-aged railroad man of Kansas City had a small daughter with
      summer diarrhea. For this she was given a patent diarrhea medicine. It
      controlled the trouble, but as soon as the remedy was withdrawn the
      diarrhea returned. At every withdrawal the trouble began anew, and the
      final result was that they never succeeded in curing this daughter of the
      opium habit which had taken its hold on her. It was some years afterward
      that the parents became aware that she had contracted the habit, when the
      physician took away the patent medicine and gave the girl morphin, with
      exactly the same result which she had experienced with the patent remedy.
      At the time the father told me this story his daughter was 19 years of
      age, an only child of wealthy parents, and one who could have had every
      advantage in life, but who was a complete wreck in every way as a result
      of the opium habit. The father told me, with tears in his eyes, that he
      would rather she had died with the original illness than to have lived to
      become the creature which she then was." The proprietor of a drug store in
      San José, Cal., writes to <i>Collier's</i> as follows:
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p041.png">[041]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      "I have a good customer, a married woman with five children, all under 10
      years of age. When her last baby was born, about a year ago, the first
      thing she did was to order a bottle of Winslow's Soothing Syrup, and every
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p042.png">[042]</a></span>week
      another bottle was bought at first, until now a bottle is bought every
      third day. Why? Because the baby has become habituated to the drug. I am
      not well enough acquainted with the family to be able to say that the
      weaned children show any present abnormality of health due to the opium
      contained in the drug, but the after-effects of opium have been thus
      described.... Another instance, quite as startling, was that of a mother
      who gave large quantities of soothing syrup to two of her children in
      infancy; then, becoming convinced of its danger, abandoned its use. These
      children in middle life became neurotics, spirit and drug-takers. Three
      children born later and not given any drugs in early life grew up strong
      and healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear the children of the woman in question will all suffer for their
      mother's ignorance, or worse, in later life, and have tried to do my duty
      by sending word to the mother of the harmful nature of the stuff, but
      without effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P. S.&mdash;How many neurotics, fiends and criminals may not 'Mrs.
      Winslow' be sponsor for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This query is respectfully referred to the Anglo-American Drug Company, of
      New York,' which makes its handsome profit from this slave trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent legislation on the part of the New York State Board of Pharmacy
      will tend to decrease the profit, as it requires that a poison label be

      An Omaha physician reports a case of poisoning from a compound bearing the
      touching name of "Kopp's Baby Friend," which has a considerable sale in
      the middle west and in central New York. It is made of sweetened water and
      morphin, about one-third grain of morphin to the ounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The child (after taking four drops) went into a stupor at once, the
      pupils were pin-pointed, skin cool and clammy, heart and respiration slow.
      I treated the case as one of opium poisoning, but it took twelve hours
      before my little patient was out of danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to put a point of satirical grimness on the matter, the responsible
      proprietor of this particular business of drugging helpless babies is a
      woman, Mrs. J. A. Kopp, of York, Pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making cocain fiends is another profitable enterprise. Catarrh powders are
      the medium. A decent druggist will not sell cocain as such, steadily, to
      any customer, except on prescription, but most druggists find salve for
      their consciences in the fact that the subtle and terrible drug is in the
      form of somebody's sure cure. There is need to say nothing of the effects
      of cocain other than that it is destructive to mind and body alike, and
      appalling in its breaking down of all moral restraint. Yet in New York
      City it is distributed in "samples" at ferries and railway stations. You
      may see the empty boxes and the instructive labels littering the gutters
      of Broadway any Saturday night, when the drug-store trade is briskest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simey's Catarrhal Powder, Dr. Cole's Catarrh Cure, Dr. Gray's Catarrh
      Powder and Crown Catarrh Powder are the ones most in demand. All of them
      are cocain; the other ingredients are unimportant&mdash;perhaps even
      superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not the bottles are labeled with the amount of cocain makes
      little difference. The habitués know. In one respect, however, the labels
      help them by giving information as to which nostrum is the most heavily
      drugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "People come in here," a New York City druggist tells me, "ask what
      catarrh powders we've got, read the labels and pick out the one that's got
      the most cocain. When I see a customer comparing labels I know she's a
      fiend." <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p043.png">[043]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally these owners and exploiters of these mixtures claim that the
      small amount of cocain contained is harmless. For instance, the "Crown
      Cure," admitting 2% per cent., says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, this is a very small and harmless amount. Cocain is now
      considered to be the most valuable addition to modern medicine... it is
      the most perfect relief known."
    </p>
    <p>
      Birney's Catarrh Cure runs as high as 4 per cent, and can produce
      testimonials vouching for its harmlessness. Here is a Birney "testimonial"
      to the opposite effect, obtained "without solicitation or payment" (I have
      ventured to put it in the approved form), which no sufferer from catarrh
      can afford to miss. IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a

      READ what William Thompson, of Chicago, says of
    </p>
    <h4>
      BIRNEY'S CATARRH CURE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      "Three years ago Thompson was a strong man. Now he is without money,
      health, home or friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      (Chicago Tribune.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I began taking Birney's Catarrh Cure (says Thompson) three years ago, and
      the longing for the drug has grown so potent that I suffer without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I followed the directions at first, then I increased the quantity until I
      bought the stuff by the dozen bottles."
    </p>
    <p>
      A famous drink and drug cure in Illinois had, as a patient, not long ago,
      a 14-year-old boy, who was a slave to the Birney brand of cocain. He had
      run his father $300 in debt, so heavy were his purchases of the poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicago long ago settled this cocain matter in the only logical way. The
      proprietor of a large downtown drug store noticed several years ago that
      at noon numbers of the shop girls from a great department store purchased
      certain catarrh powders over his counter. He had his clerk warn them that
      the powders contained deleterious drugs. The girls continued to purchase
      in increasing numbers and quantity. He sent word to the superintendent of
      the store. "That accounts for the number of our girls that have gone wrong
      of late," was the superintendent's comment. The druggist, Mr. McConnell,
      had an analysis made by the Board of Health, which showed that the powder
      most called for was nearly 4 per cent, cocain, whereon he threw it and
      similar powders out of stock. The girls went elsewhere. Mr. McConnell
      traced them and started a general movement against this class of remedies,
      which resulted in an ordinance forbidding their sale. Birney's Catarrhal
      Powders, as I am informed, to meet the new conditions brought-out a powder
      without cocain, which had the briefest kind of a sale. For weeks
      thereafter the downtown stores were haunted by haggard young men and
      women, who begged for "the old powders; these new ones don't do any good."
      As high as $1.00 premium was paid for the 4 per cent, cocain species.
      To-day the Illinois druggist who sells cocain in this form is liable to
      arrest. Yet in New York, at the corner of Forty-second street and
      Broadway, I saw recently a show-window display of the Birney cure, and
      similar displays are not uncommon in other cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding other forms of drugs there may be honest differences of opinion
      as to the limits of legitimacy in the trade. If mendacious advertising
      were stopped, and the actual ingredients of every nostrum plainly
      published <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p044.png">[044]</a></span>and
      frankly explained, the patent medicine trade might reasonably claim to be
      a legitimate enterprise in many of its phases. But no label of opium or
      cocain, though the warning skull and cross-bones cover the bottle, will
      excuse the sale of products that are never safely used except by expert
      advice. I believe that the Chicago method of dealing with the catarrh
      powders is the right method in cocain- and opium-bearing nostrums.
      Restrict the drug by the same safeguards when sold under a lying pretence
      as when it flies its true colors. Then, and then only, will our laws
      prevent the shameful trade that stupefies helpless babies and makes
      criminals of our young men and harlots of our young women.

      V.&mdash;PREYING ON THE INCURABLES.
    </h2>
    <h4>
      Reprinted from Collier's Weekly, Jan. 13, 1906. <span class="pagenum"><a

    </h4>
    <p>
      Incurable disease is one of the strongholds of the patent medicine
      business. The ideal patron, viewed in the light of profitable business, is
      the victim of some slow and wasting ailment in which recurrent hope
      inspires to repeated experiments with any "cure" that offers. In the
      columns of almost every newspaper you may find promises to cure
      consumption. Consumption is a disease absolutely incurable by any
      medicine, although an increasing percentage of consumptives are saved by
      open air, diet and methodical living. This is thoroughly and definitely
      understood by all medical and scientific men. Nevertheless there are in
      the patent medicine world a set of harpies who, for their own business
      interests, deliberately foster in the mind of the unfortunate sufferer
      from tuberculosis the belief that he can be saved by the use of some
      absolutely fraudulent nostrum. Many of these consumption cures contain
      drugs which hasten the progress of the disease, such as chloroform, opium,
      alcohol and hasheesh. Others are comparatively harmless in themselves, but
      for their fervent promises of rescue they delude the sufferer into
      misplacing his reliance, and forfeiting his only chance by neglecting
      those rigidly careful habits of life which alone can conquer the "white
      plague." One and all, the men who advertise medicines to cure consumption
      deliberately traffic in human life.

    <p>
      Certain members of the Proprietary Association of America (the patent
      medicine "combine") with whom I have talked have urged on me the claim
      that there are firms in the nostrum business that are above criticism, and
      have mentioned H. E. Bucklen &amp; Co., of Chicago, who manufacture a
      certain salve. The Bucklen salve did not particularly interest me. But
      when I came to take up the subject of consumption cures I ran unexpectedly
      on an interesting trail. In the country and small city newspapers there is
      now being advertised lavishly "Dr. King's New Discovery for Consumption."
      It is proclaimed to be the "only sure cure for consumption." Further
      announcement is made that "it strikes terror to the doctors." As it is a
      morphin and chloroform mixture, "Dr. King's New Discovery for Consumption"
      is well calculated to strike terror to the doctors or to any other class
      or profession, except, perhaps, the undertakers. It is a pretty diabolical
      concoction to give to any one, and particularly to a consumptive. The
      chloroform temporarily allays the cough, thereby checking Nature's effort
      to throw off the dead matter from the lungs. The opium drugs the patient
      into a deceived cheerfulness. The combination is admirably designed to
      shorten the life of any consumptive who takes it steadily. Of course,
      there is nothing on the label of the bottle to warn the purchaser. That
      would be an example of legitimate advertising in the consumption field.
    </p>

      Chloroform and Prussic Acid. <span class="pagenum"><a

    </p>
    <p>
      Another "cure" which, for excellent reasons of its own, does not print its
      formula, is "Shiloh's Consumption Cure," made at Leroy, N. Y., by S. C.
      Wells &amp; Co. Were it to publish abroad the fact that it contains, among
      other ingredients, chloroform and prussic acid. Under our present lax
      system there is no warning on the bottle that the liquid contains one of
      the most deadly of poisons. The makers write me: "After you have taken the
      medicine for awhile, if you are not firmly convinced that you are very
      much better we want you to go to your druggist and get back all the money
      that you have paid for Shiloh."
    </p>

    <p>
      But if I were a consumptive, after I had taken "Shiloh" for awhile I
      should be less interested in recovering my money than in getting back my
      wasted chance of life. Would S. C. Wells &amp; Co. guarantee that? <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p050.png">[050]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Morphin is the important ingredient of Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup.
      Nevertheless, the United States Postoffice Department obligingly transmits
      me a dose of this poison through the mails from A. C. Meyer &amp; Co., of
      Baltimore, the makers. The firm writes me, in response to my letter of
      inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not claim that Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup will cure an established case
      of consumption. If you have gotten this impression you most likely have
      misunderstood what we claim.... We can, however, say that Dr. Bull's Cough
      Syrup has cured cases said to have been consumption in its earliest
      stages."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite conservative, this. But A. C. Meyer &amp; Co. evidently don't follow
      their own advertising very closely, for around my sample bottle (by
      courtesy of the Postoffice Department) is a booklet, and from that booklet
      I quote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>There is no case of hoarseness, cough, asthma, bronchitis... or
      consumption that can not be cured speedily by the proper use of Dr. Bull's
      Cough Syrup</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is not a claim that Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup "will cure an
      established case of consumption," what is it? The inference from Meyer
      &amp; Co.'s cautious letter is that they realize their responsibility for
      a cruel and dangerous fraud and are beginning to feel an uneasiness about
      it, which may be shame or may be only fear. One logical effect of
      permitting medicines containing a dangerous quantity of poison to be sold
      without the poison label is shown in the coroner's verdict reproduced on
      page 47.
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p047.png">[047]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the account of the Keck baby's death from the Dr. Bull opium mixture,
      which the Cincinnati papers published, there was no mention of the name of
      the cough syrup. Asked about this, the newspapers gave various
      explanations. Two of them disclosed that they had no information on the
      point. This is contrary to the statement of the physician in the case, and
      implies a reportorial, laxity which is difficult to credit. One ascribed
      the omission to a settled policy and one to the fear of libel. When the
      coroner's verdict was given out, however, the name of the nostrum got into
      plain print. On the whole, the Cincinnati papers showed themselves
      gratifyingly independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another case of poisoning from this same remedy occurred in Morocco, Ind.,
      the victim being a 2-year-old child. The doctor reports:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In an hour, when first seen, symptoms of opium poisoning were present. In
      about twelve hours the child had several convulsions, and spasms followed
      for another twelve hours at intervals. It then sank into a coma and died
      in the seventy-two hours with cardiac failure. The case was clearly one of
      death from overdose of the remedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby had swallowed a large amount of the "medicine" from a bottle left
      within its reach. Had the bottle been properly labeled with skull and
      cross-bones the mother would probably not have let it lie about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caution seems to have become a suddenly acquired policy of this class of
      medicines, in so far as their correspondence goes. Unfortunately, it does
      not extend to their advertising. The result is a rather painful
      discrepancy. G. G. Green runs hotels in California and manufactures quack
      medicines in Woodbury, N. J., one of these being "Boschee's German Syrup,"
      a "consumption cure." Mr. Green writes me (per rubber stamp):
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consumption can sometimes be cured, but not always. Some cases are beyond
      cure. However, we suggest that you secure a trial bottle of German Syrup
      for 25 cents," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bottle I read: "Certain cure for all diseases of the throat and
      lungs." Consumption is a disease of the lungs; sometimes of the throat.
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p051.png">[051]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      If it "can sometimes be cured, but not always," then the German Syrup is
      not a "certain cure for all diseases of the throat and lungs," and
      somebody, as the ill-fated Reingelder put it, "haf lied in brint" on Mr.
      Green's bottle, which must be very painful to Mr. Green. Mr. Green's
      remedy contains morphin and some hydrocyanic acid. Therefore consumption
      will be much less often curable where Boschee's German Syrup is used than
      where it is not.

      Absolutely False Claims.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A curious mixture of the cautious, semi-ethical method and the blatant
      claim-all patent medicine is offered in the Ozomulsion Company. Ozomulsion
      does not, like the "cures" mentioned above, contain active poisons. It is
      one of the numerous cod-liver oil preparations, and its advertising, in
      tne medical journals at first and now in the lay press, is that of a cure
      for consumption. I visited the offices of the Ozomulsion Company recently
      and found them duly furnished with a regular physician, who was employed,
      so he informed me, in a purely ethical capacity. There was also present
      during the interview the president of the Ozomulsion Company, Mr. A. Frank
      Richardson, former advertising agent, former deviser of the advertising of
      Swamp-Root, former proprietor of Kranitonic and present proprietor of
      Slocum's Consumption Cure, which is the "wicked partner" of Ozomulsion.
      For convenience I will put the conversation in court report form, and,
      indeed, it partook somewhat of the nature of a cross-examination:

    <p>
      Q.&mdash;Dr. Smith, will Ozomulsion cure consumption?
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;Ozomulsion builds up the tissues, imparts vigor, aids the natural
      resistance of the body, etc. (Goes into a long exploitation in the manner
      and style made familiar by patent medicine pamphlets. )
    </p>
    <p>
      Q.&mdash;But will it cure consumption?
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;Well, without saying that it is a specific, etc. (Passes to an
      instructive, entertaining and valuable disquisition on the symptoms and
      nature of tuberculosis. )

    <p>
      Q.&mdash;Yes, but will Ozomulsion cure consumption?
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;We don't claim that it will cure consumption.

      That is as far as Dr. Smith would go. I wonder what he would have said as
      to the Dr. T. A. Slocum side of the business. Dr. Slocum puts out a
      "Special Cure Offer" that will snatch you from the jaws of death, on the
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p052.png">[052]</a></span>blanket
      plan, for $6, and guarantees the cure (or more medicine) for $10. His
      scheme is so noble and broad-minded that I can not refrain from detailing
      it. For $5 you get,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 large bottle of Psychine,
     1 large bottle of Ozomulsion,
     1 large bottle of Coltsfoote Expectorant,

     3 boxes of lazy Liver Pills
     3 Hot X-Ray Porous Plaster,

    <p>
      "which," says the certificate, "will in a majority of cases effect a
      permanent care of the malady from which the invalid is now suffering."
      Whatever ails you&mdash;that's what Dr. T. A. Sloram cures. For $10 you
      get almost twice the amount, plus the guarantee. Surely there is little
      left on earth, unless Dr. Slocum should issue a $15 offer, to include
      funeral expenses and a tombstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Slocum Consumption Cure proper consists of a gay-hued substance known
      as "Psychine." Psychine is about 16 per cent, alcohol, and has a dash of
      strychnin to give the patient his money's worth. Its alluring color is
      derived from cochineal. It is "an infallible and unfailing remedy for
      consumption." Ozomulsion is also a sure cure, if the literature is to be
      believed. To cure one's self twice of the same disease savors of reckless
      extravagance, but as "a perfect and permanent cure will be the inevitable
      consequence," perhaps it's worth the money. It would not do to charge Dr.
      T. A. Slocum with fraud, because he is, I suppose, as dead as Lydia E.
      Pinkham; but Mr. A. Frank Richardson is very much alive, and I trust it
      will be no surprise to him to see here stated that his Ozomulsion makes
      claims that it can not support, that his Psychine is considerably worse,
      that his special cure offer is a bit of shameful quackery, and that his
      whole Slocum Consumption Cure is a fake and a fraud so ludicrous that its
      continued insistence is a brilliant commentary on human credulousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the early '60s, and perhaps before, there has constantly been in the
      public prints one or another benefactor of the human race who wishes to
      bestow on suffering mankind, free of charge, a remedy which has snatched
      him from the brink of the grave. Such a one is Mr. W. A. Noyes, of
      Rochester, N. Y. To any one who writes him he sends gratis a prescription
      which will surely cure consumption. But take this prescription to your
      druggist and you will fail to get it filled, for the simple reason that
      the ingenious Mr. Noyes has employed a pharmaceutical nomenclature
      peculiarly his own If you wish to try the "Cannabis Sativa Remedy" (which
      is a mixture of hasheesh and other drugs) you must purchase it direct from
      the advertiser at a price which assures him an abnormal profit. As Mr.
      Noyes writes me proposing to give special treatment for my (supposed)
      case, depending on a diagnosis of sixty-seven questions, I fail to see why
      he is not liable for practicing medicine without a license.

      Piso Grows Cautious.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Piso's Consumption Cure, extensively advertised a year or two ago, is
      apparently withdrawing from the field, so far as consumption goes, and the
      Pino people are now more modestly promising to cure coughs and colds. Old
      analyses give as the contents of Piso's Cure for Consumption alcohol,
      chloroform, opium and cannabis indica (hasheesh). In reply to an inquiry
      as to whether their remedy contains morphin and cannabis indica, the Piso
      Company replies: "Since the year 1872 Piso's Cure has contained no morphin
      or anything derived from opium." The question as to cannabis indica is not
      answered. Analysis shows that the "cure" contains chloroform, alcohol and
      apparently cannabis indica. It is, therefore, another of the <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p053.png">[053]</a></span>remedies which
      can not possibly cure consumption, but, on the contrary, tend by their
      poisonous and debilitating drugs to undermine the victim's stamina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peruna, Liquozone, Duffy's Malt Whiskey, Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
      and the other "blanket" cures include tuberculosis in their lists,
      claiming great numbers of well-authenticated cures. From the imposing book
      published by the R. V. Pierce Company, of Buffalo, I took a number of
      testimonials for investigation; not a large number, for I found the
      consumption testimonial rather scarce. From fifteen letters I got results
      in nine cases. Seven of the letters were returned to me marked
      "unclaimed," of which one was marked "Name not in the dictory," another
      "No such postoffice in the state" and a third "Deceased." The eighth man
      wrote that the Golden Medical Discovery had cured his cough and
      blood-spitting, adding: "It is the best lung medisan I ever used for lung
      trubble." The last man said he took twenty-five bottles and was cured! Two
      out of nine seems to me a suspiciously small percentage of traceable
      recoveries. Much stress has been laid by the Proprietary Association of
      America through its press committee on the suit brought by R. V. Pierce
      against the Ladies' Home Journal, the implication being (although the suit
      has not yet been tried) that a reckless libeler of a noble and worthy
      business has been suitably punished. In the full appreciation of Dr.
      Pierce's attitude in the matter of libel, I wish to state that in so far
      as its claim of curing consumption is concerned his Golden Medical
      Discovery is an unqualified fraud.

      One might suppose that the quacks would stop short of trying to deceive
      the medical profession in this matter, yet the "consumption cure" may be
      found disporting itself in the pages of the medical journals. For
      instance, I find this advertisement in several professional magazines:
    </p>
    <p>
      "McArthur's Syrup of Hypophosphites has proved itself, time and time
      again, to be positively beneficial in this condition [tuberculosis] in the
      hands of prominent observers, clinicians and, what is more, practicing
      physicians, hundreds of whom have written their admiring encomiums in
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p054.png">[054]</a></span>its
      behalf, and it is the enthusiastic conviction of many that <i>its effect
      is truly specific</i>" Which, translated into lay terms, means that the
      syrup will cure consumption. I find also in the medical press "a sure cure
      for dropsy," fortified with a picture worthy of Swamp-Root or Lydia
      Pinkham. Both of these are frauds in attempting to foster the idea that
      they will <i>cure</i> the diseases, and they are none the less fraudulent
      for being advertised to the medical profession instead of to the laity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there, then, no legitimate advertising of preparations useful in
      diseases such as tuberculosis? Very little, and that little mostly in the
      medical journals, exploiting products which tend to build up and
      strengthen the patient. There has recently appeared, however, one
      advertisement in the lay press which seems to me a legitimate attempt to
      push a nostrum. It is reproduced at the beginning of this article. Notice,
      first, the frank statement that there is no specific for consumption;
      second, that there is no attempt to deceive the public into the belief
      that the emulsion will be helpful in all cases. Whether or not Scott's
      Emulsion is superior to other cod-liver oils is beside the present
      question. If all patent medicine "copy" were written in the same spirit of
      honesty as this, I should have been able to omit from this series all
      consideration of fraud, and devote my entire attention to the far less
      involved and difficult matter of poison. Unhappily, all of the Scott's
      Emulsion advertising is not up to this standard. In another newspaper I
      have seen an excerpt in which the Scott &amp; Bowne Company come
      perilously near making, if they do not actually make, the claim that their
      emulsion is a cure, and furthermore make themselves ridiculous by
      challenging comparison with another emulsion, suggesting a chemical test
      and offering, if their nostrum comes out second best, <i>to give to the
      institution making the experiment a supply of their oil free for a year</i>.
      This is like the German druggist who invented a heart-cure and offered two
      cases to any one who could prove that it was injurious!
    </p>
    <p>
      Consumption is not the only incurable disease in which there are good
      pickings for the birds of prey. In a recent issue of the New York Sunday
      <i>American-Journal</i> I find three cancer cures, one dropsy cure, one
      "heart-disease soon cured," three epilepsy cures and a "case of paralysis
      cured." Cancer yields to but one agency&mdash;the knife. Epilepsy is
      either the result of pressure on the brain or some obscure cerebral
      disease; medicine can never cure it. Heart disease is of many kinds, and a
      drug that may be helpful in relieving symptoms in one case might be fatal
      in another. The same is true of dropsy. Medical science knows no "cure"
      for paralysis. As space lacks to consider individually the nature of each
      nostrum separately, I list briefly, for the protection of those who read,
      a number of the more conspicuous swindles of this kind now being foisted
      on the public:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Rupert Wells' Radiatized Fluid, for cancer.
     Miles' Heart Disease Cure.
     Miles' Grand Dropsy Cure.
     Dr. Tucker's Epilepsy Cure.
     Dr. Grant's Epilepsy Cure.
     W. H. May's Epilepsy Cure.
     Dr. Kline's Epilepsy Cure.
     Dr. W. 0. Bye's Cancer Cure.
     Mason's Cancer Cure.
     Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People,
</pre>
    <p>
      which are advertised to cure paralysis and are a compound of green
      vitriol, starch and sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purchasers of these nostrums not only waste their money, but in many cases
      they throw away their only chance by delaying proper treatment until it is
      too late. <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p055.png">[055]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Properly, a "cure" known as Bioplasm belongs in this list, but so
      ingenious are its methods that it deserves some special attention. In some
      of the New York papers a brief advertisement, reading as follows, occupies
      a conspicuous position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After suffering for ten years the torture that only an ataxic can know,
      Mr. E. P. Burnham, of Delmar, N. Y., has been relieved of all pain and
      restored to health and strength, and the ability to resume his usual
      pursuits, by an easily obtained and inexpensive treatment which any
      druggist can furnish. To any fellow-sufferer who mails him a
      self-addressed envelope Mr. Burnham sends free this prescription which
      cured him."&mdash;Adv.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, people who give away something for nothing, and spend money
      advertising for a chance to do it, are as rare in the patent medicine
      business as out of it, and Delmar, N. Y., is not included in any map of
      Altruria that I have learned of E. P. Burnham, therefore, seemed worth
      writing to. The answer came back promptly, inclosing the prescription and
      explaining the advertiser's purpose:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My only motive in the notice which caught your attention is to help other
      sufferers. <i>You owe me nothing. I have nothing to sell</i>. When you are
      benefited, however, if you feel disposed and able to send me a
      contribution to assist me in making this great boon to our felow-sufferers
      better known it will be thankfully received and used for that purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear that Mr. Burnham doesn't make much money out of grateful
      correspondents who were cured of locomotor ataxia by his prescription,
      because locomotor ataxia is absolutely and hopelessly incurable. Where Mr.
      Burnham gets his reward, I fancy, is from the Bioplasm Company, of 100
      William street, New York, whose patent medicine is prescribed for me. I
      should like to believe that his "only motive is to help other sufferers,"
      but as I find, on investigation, that the advertising agents who handle
      the "Burnham" account are the Bioplasm Company's agents, I am regretfully
      compelled to believe that Mr. Burnham, instead of being of the tribe of
      the good Samaritan, is probably an immediate relative of Ananias. The
      Bioplasm Company also proposes to cure consumption, and is worthy of a
      conspicuous place in the Fraud's Gallery of Nostrums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the skin of the Ethiop is not exempt from the attention of the
      quacks. A colored correspondent writes, asking that I "give a paragraph to
      these frauds who cater to the vanity of those of my race who insult their
      Creator in attempting to change their color and hair," and inclose a
      typical advertisement of "Lustorene," which "straightens kinky, nappy,
      curly hair," and of "Lustorone Face Bleach," which "whitens the darkest
      skin" and will "bring the skin to any desired shade or color." Nothing
      could better illustrate to what ridiculous lengths the nostrum fraud will
      go. Of course, the Lustorone business is fraudulent. Some time since a
      Virginia concern, which advertised to turn negroes white, was suppressed
      by the Postoffice Department, which might well turn its attention to
      Lustorone Face Bleach.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are being exploited in this country to-day more than 100 cures, for
      diseases that are absolutely beyond the reach of drugs. They are owned by
      men who know them to be swindles, and who in private conversation will
      almost always evade the direct statement that their nostrums will "cure"
      consumption, epilepsy, heart disease and ailments of that nature. Many of
      them "guarantee" their remedies. They will return your money if you aren't
      satisfied. And they can afford to. They take the lightest of risks. The
      real risk is all on the other side. It is their few pennies per bottle
      against your life. Were the facile patter by which they lure to the
      bargain a menace to the pocketbook alone, one might regard them only as
      ordinary <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p056.png">[056]</a></span>followers
      of light finance, might imagine them filching their gain with the
      confidential, half-brazen, half-ashamed leer of the thimblerigger. But the
      matter goes further and deeper. Every man who trades in this market,
      whether he pockets the profits of the maker, the purveyor or the
      advertiser, takes toll of blood. He may not deceive himself here, for here
      the patent medicine is nakedest, most cold-hearted. Relentless greed sets
      the trap and death is partner in the enterprise.

      Advertising and testimonials are respectively the aggressive and defensive
      forces of the Great American Fraud. Without the columns of the newspapers
      and magazines wherein to exploit themselves, a great majority of the
      patent medicines would peacefully and blessedly fade out of existence.
      Nearly all the world of publications is open to the swindler, the
      exceptions being the high-class magazines and a very few independent
      spirited newspapers. The strongholds of the fraud are dailies, great and
      small, the cheap weeklies and the religious press. According to the
      estimate of a prominent advertising firm, above 90 per cent, of the
      earning capacity of the prominent nostrums is represented by their
      advertising. And all this advertising is based on the well-proven theory
      of the public's pitiable ignorance and gullibility in the vitally
      important matter of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Study the medicine advertising in your morning paper, and you will find
      yourself in a veritable goblin-realm of fakery, peopled with monstrous
      myths. Here is an amulet in the form of an electric belt, warranted to
      restore youth and vigor to the senile; yonder a magic ring or a mysterious
      inhaler, or a bewitched foot-plaster which will draw the pangs of
      rheumatism from the tortured body "or your money back"; and again some
      beneficent wizard in St. Louis promises with a secret philtre to charm
      away deadly cancer, while in the next column a firm of magi in Denver
      proposes confidently to exorcise the demon of incurable consumption
      without ever seeing the patient. Is it credible that a supposedly
      civilized nation should accept such stuff as gospel? Yet these
      exploitations cited above, while they are extreme, differ only in degree
      from nearly all patent-medicine advertising. Ponce de Leon, groping toward
      that dim fountain whence youth springs eternal, might believe that he had
      found his goal in the Peruna factory, the Liquozone "laboratory" or the
      Vitæ-Ore plant; his thousands of descendants in this century of
      enlightenment painfully drag themselves along poisoned trails, following a
      will-o'-the-wisp that dances above the open graves.

      Newspaper Accomplices.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If there is no limit to the gullibility of the public on the one hand,
      there is apparently none to the cupidity of the newspapers on the other.
      As the Proprietary Association of America is constantly setting forth in
      veiled warnings, the press takes an enormous profit from patent-medicine
      advertising. Mr. Hearst's papers alone reap a harvest of more than half a
      million dollars per annum from this source. The Chicago <i>Tribune</i>,
      which treats nostrum advertising in a spirit of independence, and
      sometimes with scant courtesy, still receives more than $80,000 a year in
      medical patronage. Many of the lesser journals actually live on patent
      medicines. What wonder that they are considerate of these profitable
      customers! Pin a newspaper owner down to the issue of fraud in the matter,
      and he will take refuge in the plea that his advertisers and not himself
      are responsible for what appears in the advertising columns. <i>Caveat
      emptor</i> is the implied superscription above this department. The more
      shame to those publications <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p058.png">[058]</a></span>which prostitute their news and
      editorial departments to their greed. Here are two samples, one from the
      Cleveland <i>Plain-Dealer</i>, the other from a temperance weekly, Green
      Goods "Cable News."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Ascatco" advertisement, which the Plain-Dealer prints as a cablegram,
      without any distinguishing mark to designate it as an advertisement, of
      course, emanates from the office of the nostrum, and is a fraud, as the <i>Plain-Dealer</i>
      well knew when it accepted payment, and became partner to the swindle by
      deceiving its readers. Tne Vitæ-Ore "editorial" appears by virtue of a
      full-page advertisement of this extraordinary fake in the same issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether, because church-going people are more trusting, and therefore more
      easily befooled than others, or from some more obscure reason, many of the
      religious papers fairly reek with patent-medicine fakes. Take, for
      instance, the <i>Christian Endeavor World</i>, which is the
      undenominational organ of a large, powerful and useful organization,
      unselfishly working toward the betterment of society. A subscriber who
      recently complained of certain advertisements received the following reply
      from the business manager of the publication:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Sir:&mdash;Your letter of the 4th comes to me for reply.
      Appreciating the good spirit in which you write, let me assure you that,
      to the best of our knowledge and belief, we are not publishing any
      fraudulent or unworthy medicine advertising. We decline every year
      thousands of dollars' worth of patent-medicine advertising that we think
      is either fraudulent or misleading. You would be surprised, very likely,
      if you could know of the people of high intelligence and good character
      who are benefited by these <span class="pagenum"><a

      deal of pains to make particular inquiries of our subscribers with respect
      to this question, and a very large percentage of them are devoted to one

      remedies. Trusting that you will be able to understand that we are acting
      according to our best and sincerest judgment, I remain, yours very truly,

      Running through half a dozen recent issues of the <i>Christian Endeavor
      World</i>, I find nineteen medical advertisements of, at best, dubious
      nature. Assuming that the business management of the <i>Christian Endeavor
      World</i> represents normal intelligence, I would like to ask whether it
      accepts the statement that a pair of "magic foot drafts" applied to the
      bottom of the feet will cure any and every kind of rheumatism in any part
      of the body? Further, if the advertising department is genuinely
      interested in declining "fraudulent or misleading" copy, I would call
      their attention to the ridiculous claims of Dr. Shoop's medicines, which
      "cure" almost every disease; to two hair removers, one an "Indian Secret,"
      the other an "accidental discovery," both either fakes or dangerous; to
      the lying claims of Hall's Catarrh Cure, that it is "a positive cure for
      catarrh" in all its stages to "Syrup of Figs," which is not a fig syrup,
      but a preparation of senna; to Dr. Kilmer's Swamp Root, of which the
      principal medicinal constituent is alcohol; and, finally, to Dr. Bye's Oil
      Cure for cancer, a particularly cruel swindle on unfortunates suffering
      from an incurable malady. All of these, with other matter, which for the
      sake of decency I do not care to detail in these columns, appear in recent
      issues of the <i>Christian Endeavor World</i>, and are respectfully
      submitted to its management and its readers.

    <h2>
      Quackery and Religion.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Baptist Watchman of Oct. 12, 1905, prints an editorial defending the
      principle of patent medicines. It would be interesting to know whether the
      back page of the number has any connection with the editorial. This page
      is given up to an illustrated advertisement of Vito-Ore, one of the
      boldest fakes in the whole Frauds' Gallery. Vitæ-Ore claims to be a
      mineral mined from "an extinct mineral spring," and to contain free iron,
      free sulphur and free magnesium. It contains no free iron, no free
      sulphur, and no free magnesium. It announces itself as "a certain and
      never-failing cure" for rheumatism and Bright's disease, dropsy, blood
      poisoning, nervous prostration and general debility, among other maladies.
      Whether it is, as asserted, mined from an extinct spring or bucketed from
      a sewer has no bearing on its utterly fraudulent character. There is no
      "certain and never-failing cure" for the diseases in its list, and when
      the <i>Baptist Watchman</i> sells itself to such an exploitation it
      becomes partner to a swindle not only on the pockets of its readers, but
      on their health as well. In the same issue I find "Piso's Cure for
      Consumption,"
    </p>

      "Bye's Cancer Cure,"
    </p>
    <p>

      A correspondent sends me clippings from <i>The Christian Century</i>,
      leading off with an interesting editorial entitled "Our Advertisers," from
      which I quote in part:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We take pleasure in calling the attention of our readers to the high
      grade of advertising which <i>The Christian Century</i> commands. We shall
      continue to advertise only such companies as we know to be thoroughly
      reliable. During the past year we have refused thousands of dollars' <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p060.png">[060]</a></span>worth of
      advertising which other religious journals are running, but which is rated
      'objectionable' by the better class of periodicals. Compare our
      advertising columns with the columns of any other purely religious
      journal, and let us know what you think of the character of our
      advertising patrons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the opinion of a non-subscriber will interest <i>The Christian
      Century</i> I have no means of knowing, but I will venture it. My opinion
      is that a considerable proportion of its advertisements are such as any
      right-minded and intelligent publisher should be ashamed to print, and
      that if its readers accept its endorsement of the advertising columns they
      will have a very heavy indictment to bring against it. Three "cancer
      cures," a dangerous "heart cure," a charlatan eye doctor, Piso's
      Consumption Cure, Dr. Shoop's Rheumatism Cure and Liquozone make up a
      pretty fair "Frauds' Gallery" for the delectation of <i>The Christian
      Century's</i> readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a convincing argument, many nostrums guarantee, not a cure, as they
      would have the public believe, but a reimbursement if the medicine is
      unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liquozone does this, and faithfully carries out its agreement.
      Electro-gen, a new "germicide," which has stolen Liquozone's advertising
      scheme almost word for word, also promises this. Dr. Shoop's agreement
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p061.png">[061]</a></span>is so
      worded that the unsatisfied customer is likely to have considerable
      trouble in getting his money back. Other concerns send their "remedies"
      free on trial, among these being the ludicrous "magic foot drafts"
      referred to above. At first thought it would seem that only a cure would
      bring profit to the makers. But the fact is that most diseases tend to
      cure themselves by natural means, and the delighted and deluded patient,
      ascribing the relief to the "remedy," which really has nothing to do with
      it, sends on his grateful dollar. Where the money is already paid, most
      people are too inert to undertake the effort of getting it back. It is the
      easy American way of accepting a swindle as a sort of joke, which makes
      for the nostrum readers ready profits.

      Safe Rewards.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then there is the "reward for proof" that the proprietary will not perform
      the wonders advertised. The Liquozone Company offer $1,000, I believe, for
      any germ that Liquozone will not kill. This is a pretty safe offer,
      because there are no restrictions as to the manner in which the
      unfortunate germ might be maltreated. If the matter came to an issue, the
      defendants might put their bacillus in the Liquozone bottle and freeze him
      solid. If that didn't end him, they could boil the ice and save their
      money, as thus far no germ has been discovered which can survive the
      process of being made into soup. Nearly all of the Hall Catarrh Cure
      advertisements offer a reward of $100 for any case of catarrh which the
      nostrum fails to cure. It isn't enough, though one hundred times that
      amount might be worth while; for who doubts that Mr. F. J. Cheney,
      inventor of the "red clause," would fight for his cure through every
      court, exhausting the prospective $100 reward of his opponent in the first
      round? How hollow the "guarantee" pretence is, is shown by a clever scheme
      devised by Radam, the quack, years ago, when Shreveport was stricken with
      yellow fever. Knowing that his offer could not be accepted, he proposed to
      the United States Government that he should eradicate the epidemic by
      destroying all the germs with Radam's Microbe Killer, offering to deposit
      $10,000 as a guarantee. Of course, the Government declined on the ground
      that it had no power to accept such an offer. Meantime, Radam got a lot of
      free advertising, and his fortune was made.

    <p>
      No little stress is laid on "personal advice" by the patent-medicine
      companies. This may be, according to the statements of the firm, from
      their physician or from some special expert. As a matter of fact, it is
      almost invariably furnished by a $10-a-week typewriter, following out one
      of a number of "form" letters prepared in bulk for the "personal-inquiry"
      dupes. Such is the Lydia E. Pinkham method. The Pinkham Company writes me
      that it is entirely innocent of any intent to deceive people into
      believing that Lydia E. Pinkham is still alive, and that it has published
      in several cases statements regarding her demise. It is true that a number
      of years ago a newspaper forced the Pinkham concern into a defensive
      admission of Lydia E. Pinkham's death, but since then the main purpose of
      the Pinkham advertising has been to befool the feminine public into
      believing that their letters go to a woman&mdash;who died nearly twenty
      years ago of one of the diseases, it is said, which her remedy claims to
      cure.

    <h2>
      The Immortal Mrs. Pinkham.
    </h2>
    <p>
      True, the newspaper appeal is always "Write to Mrs. Pinkham," and this is
      technically a saving clause, as there is a Mrs. Pinkham, widow of the son
      of Lydia E. Pinkham. What sense of shame she might be supposed to suffer
      in the perpetration of an obvious and public fraud is presumably <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p062.png">[062]</a></span>salved by the
      large profits of the business. The great majority of the gulls who "write
      to Mrs. Pinkham" suppose themselves to be addressing Lydia E. Pinkham, and
      their letters are not even answered by the present proprietor of the name,
      but by a corps of hurried clerks and typewriters.
    </p>
    <p>
      You get the same result when you write to Dr. Hartman, of Peruna, for
      personal guidance. Dr. Hartman himself told me that he took no active part
      now in the conduct of the Peruna Company. If he sees the letters addressed
      to him at all, it is by chance. "Dr. Kilmer," of Swamp-Root fame, wants
      you to write to him about your kidneys. There is no Dr. Kilmer in the
      Swamp-Root concern, and has not been for many years. Dr. T. A. Slocum, who
      writes you so earnestly and piously about taking care of your consumption
      in time, is a myth. The whole "personal medical advice" business is
      managed by rote, and the letter that you get "special to your case" has
      been printed and signed before your inquiry ever reached the shark who
      gets your money.
    </p>
    <p>
      An increasingly common pitfall is the letter in the newspapers from some
      sufferer who has been saved from disease and wants you to write and get
      the prescription free. A conspicuous instance of this is "A Notre Dame
      Lady's Appeal" to sufferers from rheumatism and also from female trouble.
      "Mrs. Summers," of Notre Dame, Ill., whose picture in the papers
      represents a fat Sister of Charity, with the wan, uneasy expression of one
      who feels that her dinner isn't digesting properly, may be a real lady,
      but I suspect she wears a full beard and talks in a bass voice, because my
      letter of inquiry to her was answered by the patent medicine firm of
      Vanderhoof &amp; Co., who inclosed some sample tablets and wanted to sell
      me more. There are many others of this class. It is safe to assume that
      every advertising altruist who pretends to give out free prescriptions is
      really a quack medicine firm in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more instance of bad faith to which the nostrum patron renders himself
      liable: It is asserted that these letters of inquiry in the patent
      medicine field are regarded as private. "All correspondence held strictly
      private and sacredly confidential," advertises Dr. R. V. Pierce, of the
      Golden Medical Discovery, etc. A Chicago firm of letter brokers offers to
      send me 50,000 Dr. Pierce order blanks at $2 a thousand for thirty days;
      or I can get terms on Ozomulsion, Theodore Noel (Vitæ-Ore), Dr. Stevens'
      Nervous Debility Cure, Cactus Cure, women's regulators, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      With advertisements in the medical journals the public is concerned only
      indirectly, it is true, but none the less vitally. Only doctors read these
      exploitations, but if they accept certain of them and treat their patients
      on the strength of the mendacious statements it is at the peril of the
      patients. Take, for instance, the Antikamnia advertising which appears in
      most of the high-class medical journals, and which includes the following
      statements:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Do not depress the heart.
     Do not produce habit.
     Are accurate&mdash;safe&mdash;sure."
</pre>
    <p>
      These three lines, reproduced as they occur in the medical journals,
      contain five distinct and separate lies&mdash;a triumph of condensed
      mendacity unequaled, so far as I know, in the "cure all" class. For an
      instructive parallel here are two claims made by Duffy's Malt Whiskey, one
      taken from a medical journal, and hence "ethical," the other transcribed
      from a daily paper and therefore to be condemned by all medical men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puzzle: Which is the ethical and which the unethical advertisement?
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p063.png">[063]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      "It is the only cure and preventative [sic] of consumption, pneumonia,
      grip, bronchitis, coughs, colds, malaria, low fevers and all wasting,
      weakening, diseased conditions." <span class="pagenum"><a

    <p>
      "Cures general debility, overwork, la grippe, colds, bronchitis,
      consumption, malaria, dyspepsia, depression, exhaustion and weakness from
      whatever cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the high-class medical publications accept the advertising of
      "McArthur's Syrup of Hypophosphites," which uses the following statement:
      "It is the enthusiastic conviction of many (physicians) that its effect is
      truly specific." That looks to me suspiciously like a "consumption cure"
      shrewdly expressed in pseudo-ethical terms.

    <h2>
      The Germicide Family.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Zymoticine, if one may believe various medical publications, "will prevent
      microbe proliferation in the blood streams, and acts as an efficient
      eliminator of those germs and their toxins which are already present."
      Translating this from its technical language, I am forced to the
      conviction that Zymoticine is half-brother to Liquozone, and if the latter
      is illegitimate at least both are children of Beelzebub, father of all
      frauds. Of the same family are the "ethicals" Acetozone and Keimol, as
      shown by their germicidal claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, I find exploited to the medical profession, through its own organa,
      a "sure cure for dropsy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hygeia presents her latest discovery," declares the advertisement, and
      fortifies the statement with a picture worthy of Swamp-Root or Lydia
      Pinkham. Every intelligent physician knows that there is no sure cure for
      dropsy. The alternative implication is that the advertiser hopes to get
      his profit by deluding the unintelligent of the profession, and that the
      publications which print his advertisement are willing to hire themselves
      out to the swindle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect some of the medical journals are far below the average of
      the newspapers, and on a par with the worst of the "religious" journals.
      They offer their reading space for sale. Here is an extract from a letter
      from the <i>Medical Mirror</i> to a well-known "ethical firm":
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should you place a contract for this issue we shall publish a 300-word
      report in your interest in our reading columns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other magazines of this class print advertisements as original
      reading matter calculated to deceive their subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back of all patent medicine advertising stands the testimonial. Produce
      proofs that any nostrum can not in its nature perform the wonders that it
      boasts, and its retort is to wave aloft its careful horde or letters and
      cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We rest on the evidence of those we have cured."
    </p>
    <p>
      The crux of the matter lies in the last word. Are the writers of those,
      letters really cured? What is the value of these testimonials? Are they
      genuine? Are they honest? Are they, in their nature and from their source,
      entitled to such weight as would convince a reasonable mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      Three distinct types suggest themselves: The word of grateful
      acknowledgement from a private citizen, couched in such terms as to be
      readily available for advertising purposes; the encomium from some person
      in public life, and the misspelled, illiterate epistle which is from its
      nature so unconvincing that it never gets into print, and which outnumbers
      the other two classes a hundred to one. First of all, most nostrums make a
      point of the mass of evidence. Thousands of testimonials, they declare,
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p065.png">[065]</a></span>just as
      valuable for their purposes as those they print, are in their files. This
      is not true. I have taken for analysis, as a fair sample, the "World's
      Dispensary Medical Book," published by the proprietors of Pierce's
      Favorite Prescription, the Golden Medical Discovery, Pleasant Pellets, the
      Pierce Hospital, etc. As the dispensers of several nostrums, and because
      of their long career in the business, this firm should be able to show as
      large a collection of favorable letters as any proprietary concern.

    <h2>
      Overworked Testimonials.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In their book, judiciously scattered, I find twenty-six letters twice
      printed, four letters thrice printed and two letters produced four times.
      Yet the compilers of the book "have to regret" (editorially) that they can
      "find room only for this comparatively small number in this volume." Why
      repeat those they have if this is true? If enthusiastic indorsements
      poured in on the patent medicine people, the Duffy's Malt Whiskey
      advertising management would hardly be driven to purchasing its letters
      from the very aged and from disreputable ministers of the gospel. If all
      the communications were as convincing as those published, the Peruna
      Company would not have to employ an agent to secure publishable letters,
      nor the Liquozone Company indorse across the face of a letter from a Mrs.
      Benjamin Charters: "Can change as we see fit." Many, in fact I believe I
      may say almost all, of the newspaper-exploited testimonials are obtained
      at an expense to the firm. Agents are employed to secure them. This costs
      money. Druggists get a discount for forwarding letters from their
      customers. This costs money. Persons willing to have their picture printed
      get a dozen photographs for themselves. This costs money. Letters of
      inquiry answered by givers of testimonials bring a price&mdash;25 cents
      per letter, usually. Here is a document sent out periodically by the
      Peruna Company to keep in line its "unsolicited" beneficiaries:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you are aware, we have your testimonial to our remedy. It has been
      some time since we have heard from you, and so we thought best to make
      inquiry as to your present state of health and whether you still
      occasionally make use of Peruna. We also want to make sure that we have
      your present street address correctly, and that you are making favorable
      answers to such letters of inquiry which your testimonial may occasion.
      Remember that we allow 25 cents for each letter of inquiry. You have only
      to send the letter you receive, together with a copy of your reply to the
      same, and we will forward you 25 cents for each pair of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hope you are still a friend of Peruna and that our continued use of
      your testimonial will be agreeable to you. We are inclosing stamped
      envelope for reply. Very sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Peruna Drug Manufacturing Company,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Per Carr."
    </p>
    <p>
      And here is an account of another typical method of collecting this sort
      of material, the writer being a young New Orleans man, who answered an
      advertisement in a local paper, offering profitable special work to a news
      paper man with spare time:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found the advertiser to be a woman, the coarseness of whose features
      was only equaled by the vulgarity of her manners and speech, and whose
      self-assertiveness was in proportion to her bulk. She proposed that I set
      about securing testimonials to the excellent qualities of Peruna, which
      she pronounced 'Pay-Runa,' for which I was to receive a fee of $5 to $10,
      according to the prominence of 'the guy' from whom I obtained it. This I
      declined <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p066.png">[066]</a></span>flatly.
      She then inquired whether or not I was a member of any social
      organizations or clubs in the city, and receiving a positive answer she
      offered me $3 for a testimonial, including the statement that Pay-Runa had
      been used by the members of the Southern Athletic Club with good effects,
      and raised it to $5 before I left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my asking her what her business was before she undertook the
      Pay-Runa work, she became very angry. Now, when a female is both very
      large and very angry, the best thing for a small, thin young man to do is
      to leave her to her thoughts and the expression thereof. I did it."

      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p067.png">[067]</a></span>
      Testimonials obtained in this way are, in a sense, genuine; that is, the
      nostrum firm has documentary evidence that they were given; but it is
      hardly necessary to state that they are not honest. Often the handling of
      the material is very careless, as in the case of Doan's Kidney Pills,
      which ran an advertisement in a Southern city embodying a letter from a
      resident of that city who had been dead nearly a year. Cause of death,
      kidney disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a former article I have touched on the matter of testimonials from
      public men. These are obtained through special agents, through hangers-on
      of the newspaper business who wheedle them out of congressmen or senators,
      and sometimes through agencies which make a specialty of that business. A
      certain Washington firm made a "blanket offer" to a nostrum company of a
      $100 joblot of testimonials, consisting of one De Wolf Hopper, one Sarah
      Bernhardt and six "statesmen," one of them a United States senator.
      Whether they had Mr. Hopper and Mme. Bernhardt under agreement or were
      simply dealing in futures I am unable to say, but the offer was made in
      business-like fashion. And the "divine Sarah" at least seems to be an easy
      subject for patent medicines, as her letters to them are by no means rare.
      Congressmen are notoriously easy to get, and senators are by no means
      beyond range. There are several men now in the United States Senate who
      have, at one time or another, prostituted their names to the uses of fraud
      medicines, which they do not use and of which they know nothing. Naval
      officers seem to be easy marks. Within a few weeks a retired admiral of
      our navy has besmirched himself and his service by acting as pictorial
      sales agent for Peruna. If one carefully considers the "testimonials" of
      this class it will appear that few of the writers state that they have
      ever tried the nostrum. We may put down the "public man's" indorsement,
      then, as genuine (documentarily), but not honest. Certainly it can bear no
      weight with an intelligent reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as eagerly sought for as this class of letter is the medical
      indorsement. Medical testimony exploiting any medicine advertised in the
      lay press withers under investigation. In the Liquozone article of this
      series I showed how medical evidence is itself "doctored." This was an
      extreme instance, for Liquozone, under its original administration,
      exhibited less conscience in its methods than any of its competitors that
      I have encountered. Where the testimony itself is not distorted, it is
      obtained under false pretences or it comes from men of no standing in the
      profession. Some time ago Duffy's Malt Whiskey sent out an agent to get
      testimonials from hospitals. He got them. How he got them is told in a
      letter from the physician in charge of a prominent Pennsylvania
      institution:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very nice appearing man called here one day and sent in his card,
      bearing the name of Dr. Blank (I can't recall the name, but wish I could),
      a graduate of Vermont University. He was as smooth an article as I have
      ever been up against, and I have met a good many. He at once got down to
      business and began to talk of the hospitals he had visited, mentioning
      physicians whom I knew either personally or by reputation. He then brought
      out a lot of documents for me to peruse, all of which were bona fide
      affairs, from the various institutions, signed by the various physicians
      or resident physicians, setting forth the merits or use of 'Duffy's Malt
      Whiskey.' He asked if I had ever used it. I said yes, but very little, and
      was at the time using some, a fact, as I was sampling what he handed me.
      He then placed about a dozen small bottles, holding possibly two ounces,
      on the table, and said I should keep it, and he would send me two quarts
      free for use here as soon as he got back."

      Getting a Testimonial from a Physician.

      next asked me if I would give him a testimonial regarding Duffy's Whiskey.
      I said I did not do such things, as it was against my principles to do so.
      'But this is not for publication,' he said. I replied that I had used but
      little of it, and found it only the same as any other whisky. He then
      asked if I was satisfied with the results as far as I had used it. I
      replied that I was. He then asked me to state that much, and I very
      foolishly said I would, on condition that it was not to be used as an
      advertisement, and he assured me it would not be used. I then, in a few
      words, said that 'I (or we) have used and are using Duffy's Malt Whiskey,
      and are satisfied with the results,' signing my name to the same. He left
      here, and what was my surprise to receive later on a booklet in which was
      my testimonial and many others, with cuts of hospitals ranging along with
      people who had reached 100 years by use of the whisky, while seemingly all
      ailments save ringbone and spavin were being cured by this wonderful
      beverage. I was provoked, but was paid as I deserved, for allowing a
      smooth tongue to deceive me. Duffy's Malt Whiskey has never been inside
      this place since that day and never will be while I have any voice to
      prevent it. The total amount used at the time and before was less than
      half a gallon."

      Many of the ordinary testimonials which come unsolicited to the
      extensively advertised nostrums in great numbers are both genuine and
      honest. What of their value as evidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years ago, so goes a story familiar in the drug trade, the general
      agent for a large jobbing house declared that he could put out an article
      possessing not the slightest remedial or stimulant properties, and by
      advertising it skillfully so persuade people of its virtues that it would
      receive unlimited testimonials to the cure of any disease for which he
      might choose to exploit it. Challenged to a bet, he became a proprietary
      owner. Within a year he had won his wager with a collection of certified
      "cures" ranging from anemia to pneumonia. Moreover, he found his venture
      so profitable that he pushed it to the extent of thousands of dollars of
      profits. His "remedy" was nothing but sugar. I have heard "Kaskine"
      mentioned as the "cure" in the case. It answers the requirements, or did
      answer them at that time, according to an analysis by the Massachusetts
      State Board of Health, which shows that its purchasers had been paying $1
      an ounce for pure granulated sugar. Whether "Kaskine" was indeed the
      subject of this picturesque bet, or whether it was some other harmless
      fraud, is immaterial to the point, which is that where the disease cures
      itself, as nearly all diseases do, the medicine gets the benefit of this
      <i>viæ medicatriæ naturæ</i>&mdash;the natural corrective force which
      makes for normal health in every human organism. Obviously, the sugar
      testimonials can not be regarded as very weighty evidence.

    <h2>
      Testimonials for a Magic Ring.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is being advertised now a finger ring which by the mere wearing
      cures any form of rheumatism. The maker of that ring has genuine letters
      from people who believe that they have been cured by it. Would any one
      other than a believer in witchcraft accept those statements? Yet they are
      just as "genuine" as the bulk of patent medicine letters and written in as
      good faith. A very small proportion of the gratuitous indorsements get
      into the newspapers, because, as I have said, they do not lend themselves
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p069.png">[069]</a></span>well to
      advertising purposes. I have looked over the originals of hundreds of such
      letters, and more than 90 per cent, of them&mdash;that is a very
      conservative estimate&mdash;are from illiterate and obviously ignorant
      people. Even those few that can be used are rendered suitable for
      publication only by careful editing. The geographical distribution is
      suggestive. Out of 100 specimens selected at random from the Pierce
      testimonial book, eighty-seven are from small, remote hamlets, whose very
      names are unfamiliar to the average man of intelligence. Only five are
      from cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants. Now, Garden City, Kas.; North
      Yamhill, Ore.; Theresa, Jefferson County, N. Y.; Parkland, Ky., and Forest
      Hill, W. Va., may produce an excellent brand of Americanism, but one does
      not look for a very high average of intelligence in such communities. Is
      it only a coincidence that the mountain districts of Kentucky, West
      Virginia and Tennessee, recognized as being the least civilized parts of
      the country, should furnish a number of testimonials, not only to Pierce,
      but to Peruna, Paine's Celery Compound and other brands, out of all
      proportion to their population? On page 65 <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p065.png">[065]</a></span> is a group of Pierce enthusiasts
      and a group of Peruna witnesses. Should you, on the face of this exhibit,
      accept their advice on a matter wholly affecting your physical welfare?
      This is what the advertiser is asking you to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure as is the present control of the Proprietary Association over the
      newspapers, there is one point in which I believe almost any journal may
      be made to feel the force of public opinion, and that is the matter of
      common decency. Newspapers pride themselves on preserving a respectable
      moral standard in their news columns, and it would require no great
      pressure on the part of the reading public (which is surely immediately
      interested) to extend this standard to the advertising columns. I am
      referring now not only to the unclean sexual, venereal and abortion
      advertisements which deface the columns of a majority of papers, but also
      to the exploitation of several prominent proprietaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently a prominent Chicago physician was dining <i>en famille</i> with a
      friend who is the publisher of a rather important paper in a Western city.
      The publisher was boasting that he had so established the editorial and
      news policy of his paper that every line of it could be read without shame
      in the presence of any adult gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never anything gets in," he declared, "that I couldn't read at this table
      before my wife, son and daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor, a militant member of his profession, snuffed battle from
      afar. "Have the morning's issue brought," he said. Turning to the second
      page he began on Swift's Sure Specific, which was headed in large black
      type with the engaging caption, "Vile, Contagious Blood Poison." Before he
      had gone far the 19-year-old daughter of the family, obedient to a glance
      from the mother, had gone to answer an opportune ring at the telephone,
      and the publisher had grown very red in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean the advertisements," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," said the visitor, curtly, and passed on to one of the extremely
      intimate, confidential and highly corporeal letters to the ghost of Lydia
      E. Pinkham, which are a constant ornament of the press. The publisher's
      son interrupted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe that was written for me to hear," he observed. "I'm too
      young&mdash;only 25, you know. Call me when you're through. I'll be out
      looking at the moon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Relentlessly the physician turned the sheet and began on one of the
      Chattanooga Medical Company's physiological editorials, entitled "What
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p070.png">[070]</a></span>Men Like
      in a Girl." For loathsome and gratuitous indecency, for leering appeal to
      their basest passions, this advertisement and the others of the Wine of
      Cardui series sound the depths. The hostess lasted through the second
      paragraph, when she fled, gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the physician to his host, "what do you think of yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The publisher found no answer, but thereafter his paper was put under a
      censorship of advertising. Many dailies refuse such "copy" as this of Wine
      of Cardui. And here, I believe, is an opportunity for the entering wedge.
      If every subscriber to a newspaper who is interested in keeping his home
      free from contamination would protest and keep on protesting against
      advertising foulness of this nature, the medical advertiser would soon be
      restricted to the same limits of decency which other classes of
      merchandise accept as a matter of course, for the average newspaper
      publisher is quite sensitive to criticism from his readers. A recent
      instance came under my own notice in the case of the <i>Auburn</i> (N. Y.)
      <i>Citizen</i>, which bought out an old-established daily, taking over the
      contracts, among which was a large amount of low-class patent medicine
      advertising. The new proprietor, a man of high personal standards, assured
      his friends that no objectionable matter would be permitted in his
      columns. Shortly after the establishment of the new paper there appeared
      an advertisement of Juven Pills, referred to above. Protests from a number
      of subscribers followed. Investigation showed that a so-called "reputable"
      patent medicine firm had inserted this disgraceful paragraph under their
      contract. Further insertions of the offending matter were refused and the
      Hood Company meekly accepted the situation. Another central New York
      daily, the <i>Utica Press</i>, rejects such "copy" as seems to the manager
      indecent, and I have yet to hear of the paper's being sued for breach of
      contract. No perpetrator of unclean advertising can afford to go to court
      on this ground, because he knows that his matter is indefensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our national quality of commercial shrewdness fails us when we go into the
      open market to purchase relief from suffering. The average American, when
      he sets out to buy a horse, or a house, or a box of cigars, is a model of
      caution. Show him testimonials from any number of prominent citizens and
      he would simply scoff. He will, perhaps, take the word of his life-long
      friend, or of the pastor of his church, but only after mature thought,
      fortified by personal investigation. Now observe the same citizen seeking
      to buy the most precious of all possessions, sound health. Anybody's word
      is good enough for him here. An admiral whose puerile vanity has betrayed
      him into a testimonial; an obliging and conscienceless senator; a grateful
      idiot from some remote hamlet; a renegade doctor or a silly woman who gets
      a bonus of a dozen photographs for her letter&mdash;any of these are
      sufficient to lure the hopeful patient to the purchase. He wouldn't buy a
      second-hand bicycle on the affidavit of any of them, but he will give up
      his dollar and take his chance of poison on a mere newspaper statement
      which he doesn't even investigate. Every intelligent newspaper publisher
      knows that the testimonials which he publishes are as deceptive as the
      advertising claims are false. Yet he salves his conscience with the
      fallacy that the moral responsibility is on the advertiser and the
      testimonial-giver. So it is, but the newspaper shares it. When an aroused
      public sentiment shall make our public men ashamed to lend themselves to
      this charlatanry, and shall enforce on the profession of journalism those
      standards of decency in the field of medical advertising which apply to
      other advertisers, the Proprietary <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p071.png">[071]</a></span>Association of America will face
      a crisis more perilous than any threatened legislation. For printers' ink
      is the very life-blood of the noxious trade. Take from the nostrum vendors
      the means by which they influence the millions, and there will pass to the
      limbo of pricked bubbles a fraud whose flagrancy and impudence are of
      minor import compared to the cold-hearted greed with which it grinds out
      its profits from the sufferings of duped and eternally hopeful ignorance.

      <i>Would any person believe that there is any one subject upon which the
      newspapers of the United States, acting in concert, by prearrangement, in
      obedience to wires all drawn by one man, will deny full and free
      discussion? If such a thing is possible, it is a serious matter, for we
      rely upon the newspapers as at once the most forbidding preventive and the
      swiftest and surest corrective of evil. For the haunting possibility of
      newspaper exposure, men who know not at all the fear of God pause,
      hesitate, and turn back from contemplated rascality. For fear "it might
      get into the papers," more men are abstaining from crime and carouse
      to-night than for fear of arrest. But these are trite things&mdash;only,
      what if the newspapers fail us? Relying so wholly on the press to undo
      evil, how shall we deal with that evil with which the press itself has
      been seduced into captivity?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Lower House of the Massachusetts Legislature one day last March
      there was a debate which lasted one whole afternoon and engaged some
      twenty speakers, on a bill providing that every bottle of patent medicine
      sold in the state should bear a label stating the contents of the bottle.
      More was told concerning patent medicines that afternoon than often comes
      to light in a single day. The debate at times was dramatic&mdash;a member
      from Salem told of a young woman of his acquaintance now in an institution
      for inebriates as the end of an incident which began with patent medicine
      dosing for a harmless ill. There was humor, too, in the debate&mdash;Representative
      Walker held aloft a bottle of Peruna bought by him in a drug store that
      very day and passed it around for his fellow-members to taste and decide
      for themselves whether Dr. Harrington, the Secretary of the State Board of
      Health, was right when he told the Legislative Committee that it was
      merely a "cheap cocktail."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Papers did not Print One Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the debate was interesting and important&mdash;the two qualities
      which invariably ensure to any event big headlines in the daily
      newspapers. But that debate was not celebrated by big headlines, nor any
      headlines at all. Yet Boston is a city, and Massachusetts is a state,
      where the proceedings of the legislature figure very large in public
      interest, and where the newspapers respond to that interest by reporting
      the sessions with greater fullness and minuteness than in any other state.
      Had that debate <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p073.png">[073]</a></span>been
      on prison reform, on Sabbath observance, the early closing saloon law, on
      any other subject, there would have been, in the next day's papers,
      overflowing accounts of verbatim report, more columns of editorial
      comment, and the picturesque features of it would have ensured the
      attention of the cartoonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now why? Why was this one subject tabooed? Why were the daily accounts of
      legislative proceedings in the next day's papers abridged to a fraction of
      their usual ponderous length, and all reference to the afternoon debate on
      patent medicines omitted? Why was it in vain for the speakers in that
      patent-medicine debate to search for their speeches in the next day's
      newspapers? Why did the legislative reporters fail to find their work in
      print? Why were the staff cartoonists forbidden to exercise their talents
      on that most fallow and tempting opportunity&mdash;the members of the
      Great and General Court of Massachusetts gravely tippling Peruna and
      passing the bottle around to their encircled neighbors, that practical
      knowledge should be the basis of legislative action?
    </p>
    <p>
      I take it if any man should assert that there is one subject on which the
      newspapers of the United States, acting in concert and as a unit, will
      deny full and free discussion, he would be smiled at as an intemperate
      fanatic. The thing is too incredible. He would be regarded as a man with a
      delusion. And yet I invite you to search the files of the daily newspapers
      of Massachusetts for March 16, 1905, for an account of the patent-medicine
      debate that occurred the afternoon of March 15 in the Massachusetts
      Legislature. In strict accuracy it must be said that there was one
      exception. Any one familiar with the newspapers of the United States will
      already have named it&mdash;the Springfield <i>Republican</i>. That paper,
      on two separate occasions, gave several columns to the record of the
      proceedings of the legislature on the patent-medicine bill. Why the
      otherwise universal silence?
    </p>
    <p>
      The patent-medicine business in the United States is one of huge financial
      proportions. The census of 1900 placed the value of the annual product at
      $59,611,355. Allowing for the increase of half a decade of rapid growth,
      it must be to-day not less than seventy-five millions. That is the
      wholesale price. The retail price of all the patent medicines sold in the
      United States in one year may be very conservatively placed at one hundred
      million dollars. And of this one hundred millions which the people of the
      United States pay for patent medicines yearly, fully forty millions goes
      to the newspapers. Have patience! I have more to say than merely to point
      out the large revenue which newspapers receive from patent medicines, and
      let inference do the rest. Inference has no place in this story. There are
      facts a-plenty. But it is essential to point out the intimate financial
      relation between the newspapers and the patent medicines. I was told by
      the man who for many years handled the advertising of the Lydia E. Pinkham
      Company that their expenditure was $100,000 a month, $1,200,000 a year.
      Dr. Pierce and the Peruna Company both advertise more extensively than the
      Pinkham Company. Certainly there are at least five patent-medicine
      concerns in the United States who each pay out to the newspapers more than
      one million dollars a year. When the Dr. Greene Nervura Company of Boston
      went into bankruptcy, its debts to newspapers for advertising amounted to
      $535,000. To the Boston <i>Herald</i> alone it owed $5,000, and to so
      small a paper, comparatively, as the Atlanta <i>Constitution</i> it owed
      $1,500. One obscure <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p074.png">[074]</a></span>quack
      doctor in New York, who did merely an office business, was raided by the
      authorities, and among the papers seized there were contracts showing that
      within a year he had paid to one paper for advertising $5,856.80; to
      another $20,000. Dr. Humphreys, one of the best known patent-medicine
      makers, has said to his fellow-members of the Patent Medicine Association:
      "The twenty thousand newspapers of the United States make more money from
      advertising the proprietary medicines than do the proprietors of the
      medicines themselves.... Of their receipts, one-third to one-half goes for
      advertising." More than six years ago, Cheney, the president of the
      National Association of Patent Medicine Men, estimated the yearly amount
      paid to the newspapers by the larger patent-medicine concerns at twenty
      million dollars&mdash;more than one thousand dollars to each daily, weekly
      and monthly periodical in the United States.

    <h2>
      Silence is the Fixed Quantity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Does this throw any light on the silence of the Massachusetts papers?
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p075.png">[075]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally such large sums paid by the patent-medicine men to the
      newspapers suggest the thought of favor. But silence is too important a
      part of the patent-medicine man's business to be left to the capricious
      chance of favor. Silence is the most important thing in his business. The
      ingredients of his medicine&mdash;that is nothing. Does the price of
      goldenseal go up? Substitute whisky. Does the price of whisky go up? Buy
      the refuse wines of the California vineyards. Does the price of opium go
      too high, or the public fear of it make it an inexpedient thing to use?
      Take it out of the formula and substitute any worthless barnyard weed. But
      silence is the fixed quantity&mdash;silence as to the frauds he practices;
      silence as to the abominable stewings and brewings that enter into his
      nostrum; silence as to the deaths and sicknesses he causes; silence as to
      the drug fiends he makes, the inebriate asylums he fills. Silence he must
      have. So he makes silence a part of the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the significant silence of the Massachusetts newspapers in the light
      of the following contracts for advertising. They are the regular printed
      form used by Hood, Ayer and Munyon in making their advertising contracts
      with thousands of newspapers throughout the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      On page 80 IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p080.png">[080]</a></span>
      is shown the contract made by the J. C. Ayer Company, makers of Ayer's
      Sarsaparilla. At the top is the name of the firm, "The J. C. Ayer Company,
      Lowell,, Mass.," and the date. Then follows a blank for the number of
      dollars, and then the formal contract: "We hereby agree, for the sum
      of............ Dollars per year,........to insert in the.............
      published at............... the advertisement of the J. C. Ayer Company."
      Then follow the conditions as to space to be used each issue, the page the
      advertisement is to be on and the position it is to occupy. Then these two
      remarkable conditions of the contract: "First&mdash;It is agreed in case
      any law or laws are enacted, either state or national, harmful to the
      interests of the T. C. Ayer Company, that this contract may be canceled by
      them from date of such enactment, and the insertions made paid for
      pro-rata with the contract price."
    </p>
    <p>
      This clause is remarkable enough. But of it more later. For the present
      examine the second clause: "Second&mdash;It is agreed that the J. C. Ayer
      Co. may cancel this contract, pro-rata, in case advertisements are
      published in this paper in which their products are offered, with a view
      to substitution or other harmful motive; also in case any matter otherwise
      detrimental to the J. C. Ayer Company's interest is permitted to appear in
      the reading columns or elsewhere in the paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      This agreement is signed in duplicate, one by the J. C. Ayer Company and
      the other one by the newspaper.

    <h2>
      All Muzzle-Clauses Alike.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That is the contract of silence. (Notice the next one, in identically the
      same language, bearing the name of the C. I. Hood Company, the other great
      manufacturer of sarsaparilla; and then the third&mdash;again in
      identically the same words&mdash;for Dr. Munyon.) That is the clause which
      with forty million dollars, muzzles the press of the country. I wonder if
      the Standard Oil Company could, for forty million dollars, bind the
      newspapers of the United States in a contract that "no matter detrimental
      to the Standard Oil Company's interests be permitted to appear in the
      reading columns or elsewhere in this paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it a mere coincidence that in each of these contracts the silence <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p076.png">[076]</a></span>clause is
      framed in the same words? Is the inference fair that there is an agreement
      among the patent-medicine men and quack doctors each to impose this
      contract on all the newspapers with which it deals, one reaching the
      newspapers which the other does not, and all combined reaching all the
      papers in the United States, and effecting a universal agreement among
      newspapers to print nothing detrimental to patent medicines? You need not
      take it as an inference. I shall show it later as a fact.

    <p>
      "In the reading columns or elsewhere in this paper." The paper must not
      print itself, nor must it allow any outside party, who might wish to do
      so, to pay the regular advertising rates and print the truth about patent
      medicines in the advertising columns. More than a year ago, just after Mr.
      Bok had printed his first article exposing patent medicines, a business
      man in St. Louis, a man of great wealth, conceived that it would <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p077.png">[077]</a></span>help his
      business greatly if he could have Mr. Bok's article printed as an
      advertisement in every newspaper in the United States. He gave the order
      to a firm of advertising agents and the firm began in Texas, intending to
      cover the country to Maine. But that advertisement never got beyond a few
      obscure country papers in Texas. The contract of silence was effective;
      and a few weeks later, at their annual meeting, the patent-medicine
      association "Resolved"&mdash;I quote the minutes&mdash;"That this
      Association commend the action of the great majority of the publishers of
      the United States who have consistently refused said false and malicious
      attacks in the shape of advertisements which in whole or in part libel
      proprietary medicines."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that the identity of the language of the silence clause in
      several patent-medicine advertising contracts suggests mutual
      understanding among the nostrum makers, a preconceived plan; and I have
      several times mentioned the patent-medicine association. It seems
      incongruous, almost humorous, to speak of a national organization of quack
      doctors and patent-medicine makers; but there is one, brought together for
      mutual support, for co-operation, for&mdash;but just what this
      organization is for, I hope to show. No other organization ever
      demonstrated so clearly the truth that "in union there is strength." Its
      official name is an innocent-seeming one&mdash;"The Proprietary
      Association of America." There are annual meetings, annual reports, a
      constitution, by-laws. And I would call special attention to Article II of
      those by-laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The objects of this association," says this article, "are: to protect the
      rights of its members to the respective trade-marks that they may own or
      control; to establish such mutual co-operation as may be required in the
      various branches of the trade; to reduce all burdens that may be
      oppressive; to facilitate and foster equitable principles in the purchase
      and sale of merchandise; to acquire and preserve for the use of its
      members such business information as may be of value to them; to adjust
      controversies and promote harmony among its members."
    </p>
    <p>
      That is as innocuous a statement as ever was penned of the objects of any
      organization. It might serve for an organization of honest cobblers.
      Change a few words, without altering the spirit in the least, and a body
      of ministers might adopt it. In this laboriously complete statement of
      objects, there is no such word as "lobby" or "lobbying." Indeed, so
      harmless a word as "legislation" is absent&mdash;strenuously absent.

    <h2>
      Where the Money Goes.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But I prefer to discover the true object of the organization of the
      "Proprietary Association of America" in another document than Article II
      of the by-laws. Consider the annual report of the treasurer, say for 1904.
      The total of money paid out during the year was $8,516.26. Of this, one
      thousand dollars was for the secretary's salary, leaving $7,516.26 to be
      accounted for. Then there is an item of postage, one of stationery, one of
      printing&mdash;the little routine expenses of every organization; and
      finally there is this remarkable item:
    </p>
    <p>
      Legislative Committee, total expenses, $6,606.95.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, the Proprietary Association of America seems to have several <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p078.png">[078]</a></span>objects, as
      stated in its by-laws, which cost it very little, and one object&mdash;not
      stated in its by-laws at all&mdash;which costs it all its annual revenue
      aside from the routine expenses of stationery, postage and secretary. If
      just a few more words of comment may be permitted on this point, does it
      not seem odd that so large an item as $6,606.95, out of a total budget of
      only $8,516.26, should be put in as a lump sum, "Legislative Committee,
      total expenses"? And would not the annual report of the treasurer of the
      Proprietary Association of America be a more entertaining document if
      these "total expenses" of the Legislative Committee were carefully
      itemized?
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p078.png">[078]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not that I mean to charge the direct corruption of legislatures. The
      Proprietary Association of America used to do that. They used to spend,
      according to the statement of the present president of the organization,
      Mr. F. J. Cheney, as much as seventy-five thousand dollars a year. But
      that was before Mr. Cheney himself discovered a better way. The fighting
      of public health legislation is the primary object and chief activity, the
      very raison d'etre, of the Proprietary Association. The motive back of
      bringing the quack doctors and patent-medicine manufacturers of the United
      States into a mutual organization was this: Here are some scores of men,
      each paying a large sum annually to the newspapers. The aggregate of these
      sums is forty million dollars. By organization, the full effect of this
      money can be got and used as a unit in preventing the passage of laws
      which would compel them to tell the contents of their nostrums, and in
      suppressing the newspaper publicity which would drive them <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p079.png">[079]</a></span>into oblivion.
      So it was no mean intellect which devised the scheme whereby every
      newspaper in America is made an active lobbyist for the patent-medicine
      association. The man who did it is the present president of the
      organization, its executive head in the work of suppressing public
      knowledge, stifling public opinion and warding off public health
      legislation, the Mr. Cheney already mentioned. He makes a catarrh cure
      which, according to the Massachusetts State Board of Health, contains
      fourteen and three-fourths per cent, of alcohol. As to his scheme for
      making the newspapers of America not only maintain silence, but actually
      lobby in behalf of the patent medicines, I am glad that I am not under the
      necessity of describing it in my own words. It would be easy to err in the
      direction that makes for incredulity. Fortunately, I need take no
      responsibility. I have Mr. Cheney's own words, in which he explained his
      scheme to his fellow-members of the Proprietary Association of America.
      The quotation marks alone (and the comment within the parentheses) are
      mine. The remainder is the language of Mr. Cheney himself:

    <h2>
      Mr. Cheney's Plan.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "We have had a good deal of difficulty in the last few years with the
      different legislatures of the different states.... I believe I have a plan
      whereby we will have no difficulty whatever with these people. I have used
      it in my business for two years and know it is a practical thing.... I,
      inside of the last two years, have made contracts with between fifteen and
      sixteen thousand newspapers, and never had but one man refuse to sign the
      contract, and my saying to him that I could not sign a contract without
      this clause in it he readily signed it. My point is merely to shift the
      responsibility. We to-day have the responsibility on our shoulders. As you
      all know, there is hardly a year but we have had a lobbyist in the
      different state legislatures&mdash;one year in New York, one year in New
      Jersey, and so on." (Read that frank confession twice&mdash;note the bland
      matter-of-factness of it.) "There has been a constant fear that something
      would come up, so I had this clause in my contract added. This is what I
      have in every contract I make: 'It is hereby agreed that should your
      state, or the United States Government, pass any law that would interfere
      with or restrict the sale of proprietary medicines, this contract shall
      become void.'... In the state of Illinois a few years ago they wanted to
      assess me three hundred dollars. I thought I had a better plan than this,
      so I wrote to about forty papers and merely said: 'Please look at your
      contract with me and take note that if this law passes you and I must stop
      doing business, and my contracts cease.'" The next week every one of them
      had an article, and Mr. Man had to go....
    </p>
    <p>
      I read this to Dr. Pierce some days ago and he was very much taken up with
      it. I have carried this through and know it is a success. I know the
      papers will accept it. Here is a thing that costs us nothing. We are
      guaranteed against the $75,000 loss for nothing. It throws the
      responsibility on the newspapers.... I have my contracts printed and I
      have this printed in red type, right square across the contract, so there
      can be absolutely no mistake, and the newspaper man can not say to me, 'I
      did not see it.' He did see it and knows what he is doing. It seems to me
      it is a point worth every man's attention.... I think this is pretty near
      a sure thing.

    <p>
      THIS IS THE FORM OF CONTRACT&mdash;SEE (A) (B) (C)&mdash;THAT MUZZLES THE
      PRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gist of the contract lies in the clause which is marked with brackets,
      to the effect that the agreement is voidable, In case any matter
      detrimental to the advertiser's interests "Is permitted to appear in the
      reading columns, or elsewhere, in this paper." This clause, in the same
      words, appears in all three of these patent-medicine advertising
      contracts. The documents reproduced here were gathered from three
      different newspapers in widely separated parts of the United States. The
      name of the paper in each case has been suppressed in order to shield the
      publisher from the displeasure of the patent-medicine combination. How
      much publishers are compelled to fear this displeasure is exemplified by
      the experience of the Cleveland <i>Press,</i> from whose columns $18,000
      worth of advertising was withdrawn within forty-eight hours. <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p081.png">[081]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I should like to ask the newspaper owners and editors of America what they
      think of that scheme. I believe that the newspapers, when they signed each
      individual contract, were not aware that they were being dragooned into an
      elaborately thought-out scheme to make every newspaper in the United
      States, from the greatest metropolitan daily to the remotest country
      weekly, an active, energetic, self-interested lobbyist for the
      patent-medicine association. If the newspapers knew how they were being
      used as cat's-paws, I believe they would resent it. Certainly the
      patent-medicine association itself feared this, and has kept this plan of
      Mr. Cheney's a careful secret. In this same meeting of the Proprietary
      Association of America, just after Mr. Cheney had made the speech quoted
      above, and while it was being resolved that every other patent-medicine
      man should put the same clause in his contract, the venerable Dr.
      Humphreys, oldest and wisest of the guild, arose and said: "Will it <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p082.png">[082]</a></span>not be now
      just as well to act on this, each and every one for himself, instead of
      putting this on record?... I think the idea is a good one, But really
      don't think it had better go in our proceedings." And another fellow
      nostrum-maker, seeing instantly the necessity of secrecy said: "I am
      heartily in accord with Dr. Humphreys. The suggestion is a good one, but
      when we come to put in our public proceedings, and state that we have
      adopted such a resolution, I want to say that the legislators are just as
      sharp as the newspaper men.... As a consequence, this will decrease the
      weight of the press comments. Some of the papers, also, who would not come
      in, would publish something about it in the way of getting square....."
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p082.png">[082]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      This contract is the backbone of the scheme. The further details, the
      organization of the bureau to carry it into effect&mdash;that, too, has
      been kept carefully concealed from the generally unthinking newspapers,
      who are all unconsciously mere individual cogs in the patent-medicine
      lobbying machine. At one of the meetings of the association, Dr. R. V.
      Pierce of Buffalo arose and said (I quote him verbatim):... "I would move
      you that the report of the Committee on Legislation be made a special
      order to be taken up immediately... that it be considered in executive
      session, and that every person not a member of the organization be asked
      to retire, so that it may be read and considered in executive session.
      There are matters and suggestions in reference to our future action, and
      measures to be taken which are advised therein, that we would not wish to
      have published broadcast over the country for very good reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what were the "matters and suggestions" which Dr. Pierce "would not
      wish to have published broadcast over the country for very good reasons?"

      Can Mr. Cheney Reconcile These Statements?

    <p>
      Letter addressed to Mr. William Allen White, Editor of the Gazette,
      Emporia, Kan.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have read with a great deal of interest, to-day, an article in Colliers
      illustrating therein the contract between your paper and ourselves, [see
      p. 18&mdash;Editor.] <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p018.png">[018]</a></span>Mr.
      S. Hopkins Adams endeavored very hard (as I understand) to find me, but I
      am sorry to say that I was not at home. I really believe that I could have
      explained that clause of the contract to his entire satisfaction, and
      thereby saved him the humiliation of making an erratic statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first intimation that I ever have had that that clause was put
      into the contract to control the Press in any way, or the editorial
      columns of the Press. I believe that if Mr. Adams was making contracts
      now, and making three-year contracts, the same as we are, taking into
      consideration the conditions of the different legislatures, he would be
      desirous of this same paragraph as a safety guard to protect himself, in
      case any State did pass a law prohibiting the sale of our goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      His argument surely falls flat when he takes into consideration the
      conduct of the North Dakota Legislature, because every newspaper in that
      State that we advertise in hid contracts containing that clause. Why we
      should be compelled to pay for from one to two years' advertising or more,
      in a State where we could not sell our goods, is more than I can
      understand. As before stated, it is merely a precautionary paragraph to
      meet conditions such as now <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p084.png">[084]</a></span>exist in North Dakota. We were
      compelled to withdraw from that State because we would not publish our
      formula, and, therefore, under this contract, we are not compelled to
      continue our advertising.

      did see it and knows what he is doing. It seems to me it is a point worth
      every man's attention.... I think this is pretty near a sure thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate: There are 739 publications in your State&mdash;619 of these
      are dailies and weeklies. Out of this number we are advertising in over
      500, at an annual expenditure of $8,000 per year (estimated). We make a
      three-year contract with all of them, and, therefore, our liabilities in
      your State are $24,000, providing, of course, all these contracts were
      made at the same date. Should these contracts all be made this fall and
      your State should pass a law this winter (three months later) prohibiting
      the sale of our goods, there would be virtually a loss to us of $24,000.
      Therefore, for a business precaution to guard against just such
      conditions, we add the red paragraph referred to in Collier's.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make this statement to you, as I am credited with being the originator
      of the paragraph, and I believe that I am justified in adding this
      paragraph to our contract, not for the purpose of controlling the Press,
      but, as before stated, as a business precaution which any man should take
      who expects to pay his bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you kindly give me your version of the situation? Awaiting an early
      reply, I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely yours,
    </p>

    <h2>
      Valuable Newspaper Aid.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p085.png">[085]</a></span> Dr.
      Pierce's son, Dr. V. Mott Pierce, was chairman of the Committee on
      Legislation. He was the author of the "matters and suggestions" which must
      be considered in the dark. "Never before," said he, "in the history of the
      Proprietary Association were there so many bills in different state
      legislatures that were vital to our interests. This was due, we think, to
      an effort on the part of different state boards of health, who have of
      late years held national meetings, to make an organized effort to
      establish what are known as 'pure food laws.'" Then the younger Pierce
      stated explicitly the agency responsible for the defeat of this public
      health legislation: "We must not forget to place the honor where due for
      our uniform success in defeating class legislation directed against our
      legitimate pursuits. The American Newspaper Publishers' Association has
      rendered us valued aid through their secretary's office in New York and we
      can hardly overestimate the power brought to bear at Washington by
      individual newspapers."... (On another occasion, Dr. Pierce, speaking of
      two bills in the Illinois Legislature, said: "Two things operated to bring
      these bills to the danger line. In the first place, the Chicago papers
      were almost wholly without influence in the Legislature.... Had it not
      been for the active co-operation of the state outside of Chicago there is
      absolute certainty that the bill would have passed.... I think that a
      great many members do not appreciate the power that we can bring to bear
      on legislation through the press.") But this power, in young Dr. Pierce's
      opinion, must be organized and systematized. "If it is not presumptuous on
      the part of your chairman," he said modestly, "to outline a policy which
      experience seems to dictate for the future, it would be briefly as
      follows"&mdash;here the younger Pierce explains the "matters and
      suggestions" which must not be "published broadcast over the country." The
      first was "the organization of a Legislative Bureau, with its offices in
      New York or Chicago. Second, a secretary, to be appointed by the chairman
      of the Committee on Legislation, who will receive a stated salary,
      sufficiently large to be in keeping with such person's ability, and to
      compensate him for the giving of all his time to this work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The benefits of such a working bureau to the Proprietary Association,"
      said Dr. Pierce, "can be foreseen: First, a systematic plan to acquire
      early knowledge of pending or threatened legislation could be taken up. In
      the past we have relied too much on newspaper managers to acquaint us of
      such bills coming up.... Another plan would be to have the regulation
      formula bill, for instance, introduced by some friendly legislator, and
      have it referred to his own committee, where he could hold it until all
      danger of such another bill being introduced were over, and the
      Legislature had adjourned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Little wonder Dr. Pierce wanted a secret session to cover up the frank
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p087.png">[087]</a></span>naïveté
      of his son, which he did not "wish to have published broadcast over the
      country, for very good reasons."

      EXAMPLE OF WHAT MR. CHENEY CALLS "SHIFTING THE RESPONSIBILITY."
    </h4>
    <p>
      This letter was sent by the publishers of one of the leading newspapers of
      Wisconsin to Senator Noble of that state. It illustrates the method
      adopted by the patent-medicine makers to compel the newspapers In each
      state to do their lobbying for them. Senator Noble introduced a bill
      requiring patent-medicine manufacturers to state on their labels the
      percentage of various poisons which every bottle might contain. Senator
      Noble and a few others fought valiantly for their bill throughout the
      whole of the last session of the Wisconsin Legislature, but were defeated
      by the united action of the newspaper publishers, who, as this letter
      shows, exerted pressure of every kind, Including threats, to compel
      members of the Legislature to vote against the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In discussing this plan for a legislative bureau, another member told what
      in his estimation was needed. "The trouble," said he&mdash;I quote from
      the minutes&mdash;"the trouble we will have in attempting to buy
      legislation&mdash;supposing we should attempt it&mdash;is that we will
      never know what we are buying until we get through. We may have paid the
      wrong man, and the bill is passed and we are out. It is not a safe
      proposition, if we consider it legitimate, which we do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      True, it is not legitimate, but the main point is, it's not safe; that's
      the thing to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patent-medicine man continued to elaborate on the plans proposed by
      Dr. Pierce: "It would not be a safe proposition at all. What this
      association should have... is a regularly established bureau.... We should
      have all possible information on tap, and we should have a list of the
      members of the legislature of every state. We should have a list of the
      most influential men that control them, or that can influence them.... For
      instance, if in the state of Ohio a bill comes up that is adverse to us,
      turn to the books, find out who are members of the legislature there, who
      are the publishers of the papers in the state, where they are located,
      which are the Republican and which the Democratic papers.... It will take
      money, but if the money is rightly spent, it will be the best investment
      ever made."

    <h2>
      The Trust's Club for Legislators.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That is about as comprehensive, as frankly impudent a scheme of
      controlling legislation as it is possible to imagine. The plan was put in
      the form of a resolution, and the resolution was passed. And so the
      Proprietary Association of America maintains a lawyer in Chicago, and a
      permanent secretary, office and staff. In every state it maintains an
      agent whose business it is to watch during the session of the Legislature
      each day's batch of new bills, and whenever a bill affecting patent
      medicines shows its head to telegraph the bill, verbatim, to headquarters.
      There some scores of printed copies of the bill are made, and a copy is
      sent to every member of the association&mdash;to the Peruna people, to Dr.
      Pierce at Buffalo, to Kilmer at Birmingham, to Cheney at Toledo, to the
      Pinkham people at Lynn, and to all the others. Thereon each manufacturer
      looks up the list of papers in the threatened state with which he has the
      contracts described above. And to each newspaper he sends a peremptory
      telegram calling the publisher's attention to the obligations of his
      contract, and commanding him to go to work to defeat the
      anti-patent-medicine bill. In practice, this organization works with
      smooth perfection and well-oiled accuracy to defeat the public health
      legislation which is introduced by boards of health in over a score of
      states every year. To illustrate, let me describe as typical the history
      of the public health bills which were introduced and defeated in
      Massachusetts last year. I have already mentioned them as showing how the
      newspapers, obeying that part of their contract which requires them to
      print nothing harmful to patent medicines, refused to print any account of
      the exposures which were made by several members of the Legislature during
      the debate of the bill. I wish here to describe their obedience to that
      other clause of the <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p088.png">[088]</a></span>contract,
      in living up to which they printed scores of bitterly partisan editorials
      against the public health bill, and against its authors personally;
      threatened with political death those members of the Legislature who were
      disposed to vote in favor of it, and even, in the persons of editors and
      owners, went up to the State House and lobbied personally against the
      bill. And since I have already told of Mr. Cheney's author-ship of the
      scheme, I will here reproduce, as typical of all the others (all the other
      large patent-medicine concerns sent similar letters and telegrams), the
      letter which Mr. Cheney himself on the 14th day of February sent to all
      the newspapers in Massachusetts with which he has lobbying contracts&mdash;practically
      every newspaper in the state:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toledo, Ohio, Feb. 14, 1905.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Publishers
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;&mdash;- Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should House bills Nos. 829, 30, 607, 724, or Senate bill No. 185 become
      laws, it will force us to discontinue advertising in your state. Your
      prompt attention regarding this bill we believe would be of mutual
      benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We would respectfully refer you to the contract which we have with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheney Medicine Company."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here is the fruit which that letter bore: a strong editorial against
      the anti-patent-medicine bill, denouncing it and its author in the most
      vituperative language, a marked copy of which was sent to every member of
      the Massachusetts Legislature. But this was not all that this one zealous
      publisher did; he sent telegrams to a number of members, and a personal
      letter to the representative of his district calling on that member not
      only to vote, but to use his influence against the bill, on the pain of
      forfeiting the paper's favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this seems to me a shameful thing&mdash;that a Massachusetts
      newspaper, of apparent dignity and outward high standing, should jump to
      the cracking of the whip of a nostrum-maker in Ohio; that honest and
      well-meaning members of the Massachusetts Legislature, whom all the money
      of Rockefeller could not buy, who obey only the one thing which they look
      on as the expression of the public opinion of their constituents, the
      united voice of the press of their district&mdash;that these men should
      unknowingly cast their votes at the dictate of a nostrum-maker in Ohio,
      who, if he should deliver his command personally and directly, instead of
      through a newspaper supine enough to let him control it for a hundred
      dollars a year, would be scorned and flouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any self-respecting newspaper must be humiliated by the attitude of the
      patent-medicine association. They don't ASK the newspapers to do it&mdash;they
      ORDER it done. Read again Mr. Cheney's account of his plan, note the
      half-contemptuous attitude toward the newspapers. And read again Mr.
      Cheney's curt letter to the Massachusetts papers; Observe the threat, just
      sufficiently veiled to make it more of a threat; and the formal order from
      a superior to a clerk: "We would respectfully refer you to the contract
      which we have with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the threat is not an empty one. The newspaper which refuses to aid the
      patent-medicine people is marked. Some time ago Dr. V. Mott <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p089.png">[089]</a></span>Pierce of
      Buffalo was chairman of what is called the "Committee on Legislation" of
      the Proprietary Association of America. He was giving his annual report to
      the association. "We are happy to say," said he, "that though over a dozen
      bills were before the different State Legislatures last winter and spring,
      yet we have succeeded in defeating all the bills which were prejudicial to
      proprietary interests without the use of money, and through the vigorous
      co-operation and aid of the publishers. January 23 your committee sent out
      letters to the principal publications in New York asking their aid against
      this measure. It is hardly necessary to state that the publishers of New
      York responded generously against these harmful measures. The only small
      exception was the <i>Evening Star</i> of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., the
      publisher of which, in a very discourteous letter, refused to assist us in
      any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it to be doubted that Dr. Pierce reported this exception to his fellow
      patent-medicine men, that they might make note of the offending paper, and
      bear it in mind when they made their contracts the following year? There
      are other cases which show what happens to the newspaper which offends the
      patent-medicine men. I am fortunate enough to be able to describe the
      following incident in the language of the man who wielded the club, as he
      told the story with much pride to his fellow patent-medicine men at their
      annual meeting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Proprietary Association," said Mr.
      Cooper, "I desire to present to you a situation which I think it is
      incumbent on manufacturers generally to pay some attention to&mdash;namely,
      the publication of sensational drug news which appears from time to time
      in the leading papers of the country.... There are, no doubt, many of you
      in the room, at least a dozen, who are familiar with the sensational
      articles that appeared in the Cleveland <i>Press</i>. Gentlemen, this is a
      question that appeals to you as a matter of business.... The Cleveland
      Press indulged in a tirade against the so-called 'drug trust.'... (the
      'drug trust' is the same organization of patent-medicine men&mdash;including
      Pierce, Pinkham, Peruna, Kilmer and all the well-known ones&mdash;which I
      have referred to as the patent-medicine association. Its official name is
      the Proprietary Association of America.) "I sent out the following letter
      to fifteen manufacturers" (of patent medicines):
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gentlemen&mdash;Inclosed we hand you a copy of matter which is appearing
      in the Cleveland papers. It is detrimental to the drug business to have
      this matter agitated in a sensational way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In behalf of the trade we would ask you to use your influence with the
      papers in Cleveland to discontinue this unnecessary publicity, and if you
      feel you can do so, we would like to have you wire the business managers
      of the Cleveland papers to discontinue their sensational drug articles, as
      it is proving very injurious to your business. Respectfully, E. R.
      Cooper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because of that letter which we sent out, the Cleveland Press received
      inside of forty-eight hours telegrams from six manufacturers canceling
      thousands of dollars' worth of advertising and causing a consequent dearth
      of sensational matter along drug lines. It resulted in a loss to one paper
      alone of over eighteen thousand dollars in advertising. Gentlemen, when
      you touch a man's pocket, you touch him where he lives; that principle
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p090.png">[090]</a></span>is true
      of the newspaper editor or the retail druggist, and goes through all
      business."

    </div>
    <h2>
      The Trust's Club for Newspapers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That is the account of how the patent-medicine man used his club on the
      newspaper head, told in the patent-medicine man's own words, as he
      described it to his fellows. Is it pleasant reading for self-respecting
      newspaper men&mdash;the exultant air of those last sentences, and the
      worldly wisdom: "When you touch a man's pocket you touch him where he
      lives; that principle is true of the newspaper editor..."?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the worst of this incident has not yet been told. There remains the
      account of how the offending newspaper, in the language of the bully, "ate
      dirt". The Cleveland <i>Press</i> is one of a syndicate of newspapers, all
      under Mr. McRae's ownership&mdash;but I will use Mr. Cooper's own words:
      "We not only reached the Cleveland <i>Press</i> by the movement taken up
      in that way, but went further, for the Cleveland <i>Press</i> is one of a
      syndicate of newspapers known as the Scripps-McRae League, from whom this
      explanation is self-explanatory:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Office Schipps-McRae Press Association.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mr. E. R. Cooper, Cleveland, Ohio:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mr. McRae arrived in New York the latter part of last week after a three
      months' trip to Egypt. I took up the matter of the recent cut-rate
      articles which appeared in the Cleveland <i>Press</i> with him, and to-day
      received the following telegram from him from Cincinnati: 'Scripps-McRae
      papers will contain no more such as Cleveland <i>Press</i> published
      concerning the medicine trust&mdash;M. A. McRae.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I am sure that in the future nothing will appear in the Cleveland Press
      detrimental to your interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "'F. J. Carlisle.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident was told, in the exact words above quoted, at the nineteenth
      annual meeting of the Proprietary Association of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could, if space permitted, quote many other telegrams and letters from
      the Kilmer's Swamp Root makers, from the Piso's Cure people, from all the
      large patent-medicine manufacturers. The same thing that happened in
      Massachusetts happened last year in New Hampshire, in Wisconsin, in Utah,
      in more than fifteen states. In Wisconsin the response by the newspapers
      to the command of the patent-medicine people was even more humiliating
      than in Massachusetts. Not only did individual newspapers work against the
      formula bill; there is a "Wisconsin Press Association," which includes the
      owners and editors of most of the newspapers of the state. That
      association held a meeting and passed resolutions, "that we are opposed to
      said bill... providing that hereafter all patent medicine sold in this
      state shall have the formula thereof printed on their labels," and
      "Resolved, That the association appoint a committee of five publishers to
      oppose the passage of the measure." And in this same state the larger
      dailies in the cities took it on themselves to drum up the smaller country
      papers and get them to write editorials opposed to the formula bill. Nor
      was even this the measure of their activity in response to the command of
      the patent medicine association. I am able to give the letter which is
      here reproduced [see page 86]. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="../44325-page-images/p086.png">[086]</a></span> It was sent by the publisher of
      one of the largest daily papers in Wisconsin to the state senator who
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p091.png">[091]</a></span>introduced
      the bill. In one western state, a board of health officer made a number of
      analyses of patent medicines, and tried to have the analyses made public,
      that the people of his state might be warned. "Only one newspaper in the
      state," he says in a personal letter, "was willing to print results of
      these analyses, and this paper refused them after two publications in
      which a list of about ten was published.
    </p>
    <p>
      In New Hampshire&mdash;but space forbids. Happily there Is a little silver
      in the situation. The legislature of North Dakota last year passed, and
      the governor signed a bill requiring that patent-medicine bottles shall
      have printed on their labels the percentage of alcohol or of morphin or
      various other poisons which the medicine contains. That was the first
      success in a fight which the public health authorities have waged in
      twenty states each year for twenty years. In North Dakota the
      patent-medicine people conducted the fight with their usual weapons, the
      ones described above. But the newspapers, be it said to their everlasting
      credit, refused to fall in line to the threats of the patent-medicine
      association. And I account for that fact in this way: North Dakota is
      wholly a "country" community.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has no city of over 20,000, and but one over 5,000. The press of the
      state, therefore, consists of very small papers, weeklies, in which the
      ownership and active management all lie with one man. The editorial
      conscience and the business manager's enterprise lie under one hat. With
      them the patent-medicine scheme was not so successful as with the more
      elaborately organized newspapers of older and more populous states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now is the North Dakota editor's time of trial. The law went into
      effect July 1. The patent-medicine association, at their annual meeting in
      May, voted to withdraw all their advertising from all the papers in that
      state. This loss of revenue, they argued self-righteously, would be a
      warning to the newspapers of other states. Likewise it would be a lesson
      to the newspapers of North Dakota. At the next session of the legislature
      they will seek to have the label bill repealed, and they count on the
      newspapers, chastened by a lean year, to help them. For the independence
      they have shown in the past, and for the courage they will be called on to
      show in the future, therefore, let the newspapers of North Dakota know
      that they have the respect and admiration of all decent people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done about it?" is the question that follows exposure of
      organized rascality. In few cases is the remedy so plain as here. For the
      past, the newspapers, in spite of these plain contracts of silence, must
      be acquitted of any very grave complicity. The very existence of the
      machine that uses and directs them has been a carefully guarded secret.
      For the future, be it understood that any newspaper which carries a
      patent-medicine advertisement knows what it is doing. The obligations of
      the contract are now public property. And one thing more, when next a
      member of a state legislature arises and states, as I have so often heard:
      "Gentlemen, this label bill seems right to me, but I can not support it;
      the united press of my district is opposed to it"&mdash;when that happens,
      let every one understand the wires that have moved "the united press of my
      district." <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p092.png">[092]</a></span>

      The Following are Extracts and Abstracts from Various Articles in the
      Ladies Home Journal?
    </p>
    <h4>
      A PECULIAR "ETC."
    </h4>
    <p>
      A great show of frankness was recently made by a certain "patent
      medicine." The makers advertised that they had concluded to take the
      public into their confidence, and that thereafter they would print a
      formula of the medicine on each bottle manufactured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing secretive about our medicine," was the cry. "We have
      nothing to hide. Here is the formula. Show it to your physician."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes the formula: This herb and that herb, this ingredient and that
      ingredient, and the formula winds up, "etc." All good, old-fashioned, well
      recognized drugs were those which were mentioned&mdash;all except the
      "etc."
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain Board of Pharmacy had never heard of a drug called "etc.," and
      so made up Its mind to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the "etc." was found to be 3.76 per cent of cocain!&mdash;just the
      simple, death-dealing cocain!&mdash;From <i>The Ladies' Home Journal</i>,
      February, 1906.

    <h4>
      PATENT MEDICINE CONCERNS AND LETTER BROKERS.
    </h4>
    <p>
      One of the most disgusting and disgraceful features of the patent medicine
      business is the marketing of letters sent by patients to patent medicine
      firms. Correspondence is solicited by these firms under the seal of sacred
      confidence. When the concern is unable to do further business with a
      patient it disposes of the patient's correspondence to a letter-broker,
      who, in turn, disposes of it to other patent medicine concerns at the rate
      of half a cent, for each letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Information was made public by Mark Sullivan in the <i>Ladies' Home
      Journal</i> for January, 1906.
    </p>
    <h4>

      An advertisement showing how the names to orders sent to "Patent Medicine"
      concerns are offered for sale or rent to be used by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet we are told how "Sacredly Confidential" these letters are regarded and
      held. (The advertisement is from the <i>Mail Order Journal</i>, April,
      1905.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Says Mr. Sullivan: "One of these brokers assured me he could give me
      'choice lots' of 'medical female letters'... Let me now give you, from the
      printed lists of these 'letter brokers' some idea of the way in which
      these <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p093.png">[093]</a></span>'sacredly
      confidential' letters are hawked about the country. Here are a few
      samples, all that are really printable:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'55,000 Female Complaint Letters' Is the sum total of one Item, and the
      list gives the names of the "medicine company" or the "medical institute"
      to whom they were addressed. Here is a barter, then, in 55,000 letters of
      a private nature, each one of which, the writer was told, and had a right
      to expect, would be regarded as sacredly confidential by the "doctor" or
      concern to whom she had been deluded into telling her private ailments.
      Yet here they are for half a cent each!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another batch of some 47,000 letters addressed to five 'doctors' and
      'institutes' is emphasized because they were all written by women! A third
      batch is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'44,000 Bust Developer Letters'&mdash;letters which one man in a "patent
      medicine" concern told me were "the richest sort of reading you could get
      hold of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A still further lot offers: '40,000 Women's Regulator Letters'&mdash;letters
      which in their context any woman can naturally imagine would be of the
      most delicate nature. Still, the fact remains, here thy are for sale."
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not this contemptible?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same article Mr. Sullivan exposes the inhuman greed of patent
      medicine concerns that turn into cold cash the letters of patients
      afflicted with the most vital diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      To quote Mr. Sullivan again: "All these are made the subject of public
      barter. Here are offered for sale, for example: 7,000 Paralysis Letters;
      9,000 Narcotic Letters; 52,000 Consumption Letters; 3,000 Cancer Letters,
      and even 65,000 Deaf Letters. Of diseases of the most private nature one
      is offered here nearly one hundred thousand letters&mdash;letters the very
      classification of which makes a sensitive person shudder."

    <h2>
      An Appeal To The American Woman.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "If the American woman would withhold her patronage from these secret
      nostrums the greater part of the industry would go to pieces. I do not ask
      any woman to take my word for this. Let me give her a personal statement
      direct from one of these manufacturers himself&mdash;a 'doctor' to whom
      thousands of women are writing to-day, and whose medicines they are buying
      by the hundreds of thousands of bottles each year. I quote his own
      statement, word for word:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Men are "on" to the game; we don't care a damn about them. It is the
      women we are after. We have buncoed them now for a good many years, and so
      long as they remain as "easy" as they have been, and we can make them
      believe that they are sick, we're all right. Give us the women every time.
      We can make them feel more female troubles In a year than they would
      really have if they lived to be a hundred.' ".&mdash;From "Why 'Patent
      Medicines' are Dangerous," Edward Bok, Ladies' Home Journal, March, 1905.
    </p>
    <h4>
      "REPEATERS."
    </h4>
    <p>
      It is the "repeat" orders that make the profit. Referring to a certain
      patent medicine that had gone to the wall a nostrum agent said that It
      failed because "it wasn't a good repeater." When these men doubt whether a
      new medicine will be a success they say: "I'm afraid it wouldn't be a
      'repeater.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Cure</i> rheumatism" said a veteran patent medicine man considering
      the exploitation of a new remedy; "good Heavens, man, you don't want a
      remedy that <i>cures</i> 'em. Where would you get your 'repeats'? You want
      to get up a medicine that's full of dope, so the more they take of it the
      more they'll want."&mdash;From "The Inside Story of a Sham," <i>Ladies'
      Home Journal</i>, January, 1906.

    <h4>
      PATENT MEDICINES AND TESTIMONIALS.
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the January, 1906, issue of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> Mark
      Sullivan contributes an article on the business of securing from
      well-known people testimonials indorsing and praising nostrums. Mr.
      Sullivan learned that three men, rivals in trade, make a business of
      securing these indorsements. They are known as "testimonlal-brokers."
    </p>
    <p>
      A representative of a patent medicine who was anxious to exploit his
      preparation through the press approached one of these brokers and made
      arrangements for the delivery of one hundred signed testimonials from
      members of <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p094.png">[094]</a></span>congress,
      governors and men high in the Army and Navy. The following is the
      memorandum of the agreement as drawn up by the broker:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confirming my talk with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I will undertake to
      obtain testimonials from senators at $75 each, and from congressmen at
      $40, on a prearranged contract.... A contract for not less than $5,000
      would meet my requirements In the testimonial line.... I can put your
      matter in good shape shortly after congress meets if we come to an
      agreement.... We can't get Roosevelt, but we can get men and women of
      national reputation, and we can get their statements in convincing form
      and language..."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for this reason that years ago Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass.,
      determined to step in and help her sex. Having had considerable experience
      in treating female ills with her Vegetable Compound, she encouraged the
      women of America to write to her for advice in regard to their complaints,
      and being a woman, it was easy for help ailing sisters to pour into her
      ears every detail of their suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      No physician in the world has had such a training, or has such an amount
      of information at hand to assist in the treatment of all kinds of female
      ills.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, therefore, is the reason why Mrs. Pinkham, in her laboratory at
      Lynn, Mass., Is able to do more for the ailing women, of America than the
      family physician.' Any woman, therefore, is responsible for her own
      suffering who will not take the trouble to write to Mrs. Pinkham for
      advice.
    </p>
    <h4>
      IMAGE ==> <span class="pagenum"><a href="../44325-page-images/p094.png">[094]</a></span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The way in which the testimonial is actually obtained is thus described by
      the broker:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The knowing how to approach each individual is my stock-in-trade. Only a
      man of wide acquaintance of men and things could carry it out. Often I
      employ women. Women know how to get around public men. For example, I know
      that Senator A has a poverty-stricken cousin, who works as a seamstress. I
      go to her and offer her twenty-five dollars to get the senator's signature
      to a testimonial. But most of it I do through newspaper correspondents
      here in Washington. Take the senator from some southern state. That
      senator is very dependent on the Washington correspondent of the leading
      newspaper in his state. By the dispatches which that correspondent sends
      back the senator's career is made or marred. So I go to that
      correspondent. I offer him $50 to get the senator's testimonial. The
      senator may squirm, but he'll sign all right. Then there are a number of
      easy-going congressmen who needn't be seen at all. I can sign their names
      to anything, and they'll stand for it. And there are always a lot of
      poverty-stricken, broken-down Army veterans hanging around Washington. For
      a few dollars they'll go to their old Army officers on a basis of old
      acquaintance sake and get testimonials."
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that such testimonials are a fraud on the purchaser
      of the medicine thus exploited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one in a thousand of these letters ever reaches the eyes of the
      'doctor' to whom they are addressed. There wouldn't be hours enough in the
      day to read them even if he had the desire. On the contrary, these letters
      from women of a private and delicate nature are opened and read by young
      men and girls; they go through not fewer than eight different hands before
      they reach a reply; each in turn reads them, and if there is anything
      'spicy' you will see the heads of two or three girls get together and
      enjoy (!) the 'spice.' Very often these 'spicy bits' are taken home and
      shown to the friends and families of these girls and men! Time and again
      have I seen this done; time and again have I been handed over a letter by
      one of the young fellows with the remark: 'Read this, isn't that rich?'
      only to read of the recital of some trouble into which a young girl has
      fallen, or some mother's sacred story of her daughter's all!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, to cap the climax of iniquity, with some of these houses these
      names and addresses are sold at two, three or five cents a name to firms
      in other lines of business for the purpose of sending circulars. As a
      fact, often the trouble is not taken to copy off the names and addresses,
      but the letters themselves, with all their private contents, are sold!
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the true story of the 'sacredly confidential' way in which these
      private letters from women are treated!"&mdash;Statement of a man who
      spent two years in the employ of a large patent medicine concern, as told
      in "How the Private Confidences of Women Are Laughed At." Edward Bok, <i>Ladies'
      Home Journal,</i> November, 1904.
